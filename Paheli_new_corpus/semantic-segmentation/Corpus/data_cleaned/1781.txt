, the Divisional Joint Director of the Sales TaxDepartment	PREAMBLE
granted exemption for a period of three yearsonly commencing from 1.3.85.         	PREAMBLE
The petitioners filed a review application contendingthat the exemption should be with effect from 20.5.86, onwhich date the power connection was given and productioncommenced with the help of electricity and that theexemption should be for five years from 20.5.86, since onthat date their capital investment was more than Rs.3,00,000including Rs. 72,800, the cost of diesel set purchased bythem.	PREAMBLE
The petitioners' plea that 30.3.85 as the date offirst sale was accepted, but their plea that the date ofstarting of production should be 20.5.86 was rejected.	PREAMBLE
Hence the petitioners filed a Writ Petition before the HighCourt.	PREAMBLE
         Rejecting the petitioners' pleas that the date ofgetting power connection, i.e. 20.5.86 should be taken asthe date of starting production, and that the capitalinvestment in the unit was more than Rs. 3,00,000 during                                                                                                   595the period between 1.3.85 i.e. the date of startingproduction, and 30.3.85, i.e. the date of first sale, theHigh Court held that the first sale, i.e. 30.3.1985, shouldbe taken as date of commencement of the period of exemptionand that the petitioners were entitled for exemption onlyfor a period of three years from that date in view ofSection 4-A of the Act and the relevant notifications.         	PREAMBLE
In the special leave Petition before this Court, thepetitioners contended that once it was accepted that thedate of first sale was 30.3.85, the cost of diesel unitamounting to Rs. 72,800 should also be included in thecapital investment, in which case the total capitalinvestment would be above Rs. 3 lakhs and accordingly, theexemption should be for five years as per the relevantprovisions.	PREAMBLE
         Disposing of the Special Leave Petition, this Court,         HELD: 1.	PREAMBLE
The petitioners are entitled for exemptionunder Section 4-A of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948, for fiveyears from 30.3.1985 and accordingly they should be giventhe benefit.	PREAMBLE
         2.1.	PREAMBLE
Section 4-A of the Act provides for grantingexemption to the new industrial units with a view toincrease the production of any goods and the period ofexemption should be from the date of first sale within thesix months' time from the date of starting production.	PREAMBLE
TheNotification dated 29.1.1985 issued by the State Governmentunder Section 4-A specified the date of commencement of theperiod of exemption as the date of first sale, if such saletook place not later than six months from the date ofstarting production, or, in other cases, from the datefollowing the expiration of six months from the date ofstarting production.	PREAMBLE
Column 3 of the Table appended to theNotification shows that in respect of the units mentionedtherein in Serial No. 3, the exemption should be for threeyears if the total capital investment does not exceed Rs.3,00,000 and if it exceeds Rs. 3,00,000 it should be fiveyears.	PREAMBLE
[598A-B, E]         2.2	PREAMBLE
In the instant case, the petitioners' case has beenthat they purchased and installed a diesel unit on 4.3.1985amounting to Rs. 72,800 and as such, it must be held thatthe cost of the diesel unit should be included in thecapital investment, in which case the total capitalinvestment would be more than Rs. 3,00,000 on the date offirst sale, namely, 30.3.1985, and therefore, the exemptionshould be for five years.	PREAMBLE
The Joint                                                                                                   596	PREAMBLE
Director rejected the claim to include the cost of dieselunit on the sole ground that it was purchased after startingproduction.	PREAMBLE
However, before the High Court the StateGovernment alongwith their counter-affidavit have annexedthe bill dated 4.3.1985, which shows that the diesel set waspurchased by the petitioners for total cost of Rs. 72,800.Therefore, it cannot be in dispute that the diesel set waspurchased by the petitioners on 4.3.1985.	PREAMBLE
[598E, 601D]         2.3	PREAMBLE
. In view of the categorical finding of the HighCourt that the date of commencement of production was1.3.1985 and the date of first sale was 30.3.1985, the dateof purchase of diesel set which is 4.3.1985, was clearlyprior to the date of first sale, and, therefore, the cost ofthe diesel set should also be included in the capitalinvestment as on 30.3.1985, and then it would be more thanRs. 3,00,000.	PREAMBLE
Thus, it is clear that the exemption shouldbe for five years from 30.3.1985 i.e. date of first sale,	PREAMBLE

         The following Order of the court was delivered: The matter is being disposed of at the stage of admission after hearing both sides.	NONE
         The petitioners in these appeals have filed the S.L.P.against the order of the Allahabad High Court.	FAC
The petitioners belong to a re-established small scale industrial unit for manufacturing cycle stands and carriers during the year 1984-85.	FAC
They applied for power connection in December, 1984 but it was sanctioned on 19.1.86.	FAC
Meanwhile the petitioners, however, started production manually with effect from 1.3.85.	FAC
They effected their first sale of the manufactured goods on 30.3.85.	FAC
It is their case that they purchased a diesel unit and installed it on 4.3.85.	FAC
According to them the total investment including the cost diesel unit 597 was more than Rs. 3,00,000 as on 30.3.85, when the first sale was effected.	FAC
The petitioners applied for exemption from the payment of sales tax under Section 4-A of the U.P.Sales Tax Act and the Notifications thereunder issued from time to time.	FAC
The Divisional Joint Director by his Order dated 26.4.1988 informed the petitioners that exemption was granted under Section 4-A for a period of three years only commencing from 1.3.85.	FAC
A review was filed by the petitioners contending that the exemption should be with effect from 20.5.86 on which date the power connection was given and production commenced with the help of electricity and on that date their capital investment was more than Rs.3,00,000 and therefore the exemption should be for five years.	FAC
By proceedings dated 23.12.1988 the petitioners were informed that 30.3.85 has been accepted as the date of first sale, but their plea that the date of starting of production should be 20.5.85 was rejected.	FAC
Questioning the same a Writ Petition was filed before the High Court.	FAC
 The High Court accepted the petitioners' plea that 30.3.85 is the date of first sale manufactured goods by the petitioners.	FAC
However, the plea of the petitioners that the date of getting power connection i.e. 20.5.86 should be taken as the date of starting production was rejected.	FAC
The High Court also observed that the date of first sale, namely 30.3.85, should be taken as the date of commencement of the period of exemption.	FAC
Having thus found, the High court, however was not prepared to accept the petitioners' plea that the capital investment in the unit was more than Rs.3,00,000 during the period between 1.3.85, i.e. the date of starting production, and 30.3.85, i.e. the date of first sale.	FAC
In the result, it was declared that the petitioners were entitled for exemption only for a period of three years from the date of first sale, namely 30.3.85, in view of Section 4-A of the Act and the relevant notifications.	FAC
The learned counsel for the petitioners contended that when once it is accepted that the date of first sale is 30.3.85, then the exemption should be on the basis of the capital investment as it stood on that date and since the petitioners have already installed the diesel unit and the cost of diesel unit amounting to Rs. 72,800 should also be included in the capital investment, then the total capital investment would be above Rs. 3,00,000 and on which the exemption should be for five years as per the relevant provisions.	ARG_PETITIONER
To appreciate this contention it becomes necessary to refer to some of the provisions and the notifications thereunder.	ANALYSIS
598 Section 4-A of the Act provides for granting exemption to the new industrial units with a view to increase the production of any goods and the period of exemption should be from the date of the first sale within the six months' time from the date of starting production.	ANALYSIS
A Notification was issued by the State Government on 29.1.85 under Section 4-A of the Act specifying the date of commencement of the period of exemption as "the date of first sale, if such sale takes place not later than six months from the date of starting production, or, in other cases, from the date following the expiration of six months from the date of starting production".	ANALYSIS
In the light of the above provisions and the notifications thereunder, the date of exemption in the instant case should be taken as 30.3.1985, namely the date of first sale.	ANALYSIS
This aspect is not in dispute.	ANALYSIS
Then the question is whether the exemption should be for three years or five years?	ANALYSIS
It depends upon the question as to what was the total capital investment on 30.3.1985; was it less than Rs. 3,00,000 or more?	ANALYSIS
         Column 3 of the Table appended to the Notification dated 29.1.1985 issued under Section 4-A of the Act shows that in respect of the units mentioned therein in Serial No.3, the exemption should for three years if the total capital investment does not exceed Rs. 3,00,000 and if it exceeds Rs. 3,00,000 it should be five years.	ANALYSIS
The petitioners' case throughout has been that they purchased and installed a diesel unit on 4.3.1985 amounting to Rs. 72,800 and that since the same is not in dispute at all, it must be held that the cost of the diesel unit should be included in the capital investment, and then the total capital investment would be more than Rs. 3,00,000 as on the date of first sale namely 30.3.1985, in which case the exemption should be for five years.	ANALYSIS
We may mention here that this point was not considered by the High Court in the manner it is submitted by the petitioners.	ANALYSIS
No doubt, before the High Court the petitioners' contention was that the date 20.5.86, when the power was supplied, should be the date of starting of production and from that date the exemption should be for five years.	ANALYSIS
The High Court rejected this contention by observing: "The petitioners did not aver specifically that even on 1.3.1985/30.3.1985, their investment was more than rupees three lacks.	ANALYSIS
In such a situation, we cannot find fault with the authority for not recording a clear find on this issue".         	ANALYSIS
In observing so, the High Court relied on two paragraphs in the 599 review petition filed before the Sales Tax Authorities.	ANALYSIS
The learned counsel submitted that even if the period of exemption cannot be reckoned from 20.5.86 (the date on which the power was supplied), yet the same should be reckoned atleast from 30.3.1985, on which date the total capital investment was above Rs. 3,00,000 undoubtedly.	ARG_PETITIONER
The learned counsel for the State submitted that such a contention was not put forward by the petitioners before the High Court and, therefore, the petitioners cannot raise the same before this Court.	ARG_RESPONDENT
 The High Court has given a categorical finding as under: "In the circumstances of the present case, we find that the date of starting production in the petitioners unit is 1.3.1985 and in view of sub- section (1) of section 4-A, the date of the first sale, i.e., 30.3.1985, should be taken as the date of commencement of the period of exemption, the same falling within six months of the date of starting production".	RLC
(emphasis supplied)	RLC
Therefore, 30.3.1985 should be the date of commencement of the period of exemption.	RLC
In the review petition filed before the Joint Director of Industries, no doubt, it is clearly mentioned that on 19.4.1986 the capital investment was Rs. 5,26,273 and that the Sales Tax Officer cannot reduce the capital investment by excluding the cost of diesel set.	RLC
But in the counter-affidavit filed by the State Government before the High Court, it is mentioned thus: "The dealer filed a review application before the Joint Director of Industries stating that exemption should be granted w.e.f. 30.3.85, the date of first sale.	RLC
It was also stated that capital investment upto 30.3.85 was more than 3 lacks including generator for Rs. 72,800 purchase vide Bill No. 107/84-85 dt. 4.3.85.	RLC
Regarding this application enquiries were made and it was found that dealer started production from 1.3.85 manually and he had not purchased any machine driven by power before 1.3.85 and generator was purchased locally on 4.3.85 i.e. after the date of starting production vide Bill No. 107/84-85 dated 4.3.85 for Rs. 72,800 by transfer of documents against form `C'. 	RLC
Therefore, investment in the generator cannot be included in the machinary investment because the generator was not used 600 for production."	RLC
Relying on these admissions, the learned counsel submitted that it is an admitted fact that the Bill dated 4.3.85 which is for Rs. 72,800 in respect of the diesel set purchased should be included in the capital investment and that the Joint Director excluded that amount on the wrong assumption that the exemption period should be counted from the date of production and the total investment as on that day alone is relevant which is erroneous.	ARG_PETITIONER
From the above material it cannot be said that this aspect was not an issue before the High Court but the same lost its significance in view of the larger claim made by the petitioners that the exemption should be from 20.5.86.	ANALYSIS
The learned counsel for the State, however, submits that the matter may be remanded.	ARG_RESPONDENT
We do not think it is necessary to do so in view of the cogent and clear material, which cannot be controverted.	ANALYSIS
 Before proceeding we may extract the order which was impugned before the High Court: "Letter No. 8971                   DS/8/Sales Tax/88-89 Office Joint Director Industries(D.S.) Dated: 29th Dec. 1988 M/s. Vijay Enterprises, 93, A Cooperative Ind. Estate Kanpur.	ANALYSIS
 Kindly refer to your letter dated 16.6.1988 which is on the subject of reconsideration of relief of exemption of Sales Tax granted to your unit.	ANALYSIS
The Division of committee in meeting dated 23.12.1988 having considered in this respect has decided as follows: 1. Sales Tax exemption is hereby amended with effect from date of first sale 30.3.1985 instead of date of production 1.3.1985 for 3 years.	ANALYSIS
The other terms relating to exemption shall be according to eligibility certificate dated 26.4.1988. 2. Investment on land/building exceeds the necessity. 	ANALYSIS
The generator is not utilised for starting production and the permission of the Electricity 601 Department for this is also not there.	ANALYSIS
The Generator has been purchased after starting production hence investment of generator amounting to Rs. 72,800 till the date of starting production is not acceptable as capital investment.	ANALYSIS
Thus on the date of starting production investment on Land/Building and Machines is less than Rs. 3 lakhs.	ANALYSIS
Hence the demand for 5 years tax exemption is rejected.	ANALYSIS
sd/- Joint Director Industries (DS)" [emphasis supplied]	NONE
The last few lines in the above Order which are underlined show that the Joint Director rejected the claim to include the cost of diesel unit on the sole ground that it was purchased after starting production.	ANALYSIS
Before the High Court the State Government alongwith their counter-affidavit have annexed the Bill dated 4.3.1985 which shows that the diesel set was purchased by the petitioners for total cost of Rs. 72,800.	ANALYSIS
If we take into the account the above admission made in the counter-affidavit by the State Government and the contents of this bill it cannot be in dispute that the diesel set was purchased by the petitioners on 1.3.1985.	ANALYSIS
Now, in view of the categorical finding of the High Court that the date of commencement of production was 1.3.1985 and the date of first sale was 30.3.85, the date of purchase of diesel set which is 4.3.1985 was clearly prior to the date of first sale, and therefore, the cost of the diesel set should also be included in the capital investment as on 30.3.1985, and then it would be more than Rs. 3,00,000.	RATIO
Thus the position becomes clear that the exemption should be for five years from the date of 30.3.1985 as per the relevant provisions mentioned above.	RATIO
 We are satisfied that the petitioners are entitled for exemption under Section 4-A of the U.P. Sales Tax Act for five years from 30.3.1985 and accordingly they should be given the benefit.	ANALYSIS
 With this direction the Special Leave Petition is disposed of.	RPC
There will be no order as to costs.	RPC
