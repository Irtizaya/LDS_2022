ORAL JUDGMENT : (PER M.L. TAHALIYANI, J.) 	PREAMBLE
1.  These two appeals are being decided by the common judgment as they arise out of the conviction recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Pandharkawada (Kelapur) in Sessions Trial No.64/2004.	FAC
The appellant Hemant Kawadu Chauriwal in Criminal Appeal No.53/2007 and the appellant Sau.

. 2.  The appellant in Appeal No.53/2007 will be referred to as 'appellant No.1' and appellant in Appeal No.70/2007 will be referred to as 'appellant No.2' hereinafter.	FAC
 3.  The deceased Asha Hemant Chauriwal (hereinafter referred to as 'deceased'), daughter of P.W.3Devidas Atmaram Dohare and P.W.4Sau. Chandrakala Devidas Dohare, was married to appellant No.1 on 29th May, 2001.	FAC
After the marriage, she went to stay with appellant No.1 at Ghatanji.	FAC
Appellant No.1 was member of joint family of which appellant No.2 and other accused were also members.	FAC
Original accused No.2 is father of appellant No.1 and husband of appellant No.2.	FAC
Original accused No.3 is brother of appellant No.1 and original accused No.5 is a sister of appellant No.1.	FAC
 4.  It is alleged that after the marriage, the deceased was being subjected to mental and physical cruelty on the ground that she had not brought sufficient valuable articles in dowry.	FAC
The deceased was not being given sufficient food to eat.	FAC
She was being tortured every now and then on the ground that she did not know cooking and that the food cooked by her was not tasty enough.	FAC
These facts she had been disclosing to her parents whenever she visited her parental house.	FAC
 5.  The incident in question had occurred on 20th June, 2004 at matrimonial home of the deceased.	FAC
It is alleged that the appellants had poured kerosene on the deceased and had set her on fire.	FAC
She was thereafter taken to Ghatanji Hospital for treatment.	FAC
She was removed to Yavatmal Government Hospital for further treatment.	FAC
In the meantime, the news was received by parents of the deceased.	FAC
They also reached the hospital at Yavatmal.	FAC
Police Officer from Yavatmal Police had requested the Naib Tahsildar Smt. Pushpalata Bharti (P.W.1) to record statement of the deceased at Yavatmal General Hospital.	FAC
The request letter was handed over to the NaibTahsildar by a Police Constable.	FAC
The NaibTahsildar reached the hospital.	FAC
She took opinion of the Medical Officer with regard to the condition of the deceased and thereafter she recorded statement of the deceased.	FAC
The deceased had allegedly stated before the NaibTahsildar (Executive Magistrate) that since her parents had not given sufficient dowry at the time of marriage, she was being physically assaulted.	FAC
It was further stated by her that on 20th June, 2004 at about 800 a.m. appellant No.1 had poured kerosene on her and set her on fire.	FAC
Appellant No.2 and other accused had abused her and had assaulted her.	FAC
She had further stated that her husband should be punished for crime committed by him.	FAC
The statement of the deceased was recorded at about 5.45 p.m. on 20th June, 2004.	FAC
 6.  Since the incident had occurred at Ghatanji and the police of Ghatanji came to know about the incident, a Police Officer from Ghatanji Police Station had reached the spot and had drawn detail crime report, which includes the panchanama.	FAC
The offence was registered at Ghatanji Police Station on 21st June, 2004 after receipt of the above stated dying declaration recorded by Executive Magistrate by Ghatanji Police Station from Yavatmal Police Station.	FAC
The First Information Report was registered for the offences punishable under Sections 307 and 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.	FAC
The deceased died on 22nd June, 2004.	FAC
After the death of deceased Asha Hemant Chauriwal, the police started investigation for the offences punishable under Sections 302 and 304B of the Indian Penal Code also.	FAC
 7.  During the course of investigation, statements of parents of the deceased were recorded.	FAC
Dead body was subjected to postmortem examination.	FAC
All the injuries on the deceased were found ante mortem.	FAC
The deceased had sustained about 88% of burn injuries on various limbs from neck to lower limbs.	FAC
The cause of death was stated to be septicemia as a result of 88% dermo epidermal infected burn injuries.	FAC
After completion of investigation, chargesheet was filed in the court of Magistrate.	FAC
 8.  The learned trial Judge framed charge against appellant No.1 for the offences punishable under Sections 302, 304B and 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.	FAC
As far as appellant No.2 and other accused are concerned, the learned trial Judge had framed charge against them for the offences punishable under Sections 498A and 304B read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.	FAC
The appellants and the other accused had pleaded not guilty to the charge.	FAC
The defence of the appellants and the other accused was that the deceased had committed suicide by pouring kerosene on herself.	FAC
It was their case that the parents of the appellants had taken the deceased to the hospital for treatment after breaking open the door of the room where she had committed suicide.	FAC
9.           	FAC
The prosecution had examined in all six witnesses in support of its case.	FAC
P.W.1Pushpalata Bharti is the Executive Magistrate, who had recorded the statement of the deceased at Government Hospital, Yavatmal.	FAC
 P.W.2Prakash is the Police Constable who had carried dying declaration of the deceased from Yavatmal to Ghatanji.	FAC
P.W.3Devidas and P.W.4 Chandrakala are the father and mother respectively of the deceased.	FAC
P.W.5 Dr. Sarika Naik is the Medical Officer who had examined the deceased before recording of her dying declaration.	FAC
P.W.6Dipak Gotmare is the Police Officer, who had carried out the investigation.	FAC
The PostMortem Report at Exh.97 was admitted to be true and correct by the appellants and the other accused.	FAC
 10.          As such the cause of death has not been disputed by the appellants.	FAC
The question before the trial Court was as to whether 88% burn injuries, which resulted into septicemia and ultimately caused death of the deceased, were caused by the appellants and the other accused.	FAC
All the accused have been acquitted of the offence punishable under Section 304B read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.	RLC
However, the appellant No.1 has been convicted of the offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.	RLC
 11.  Before we examine the order of conviction for the offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code recorded against both the appellants, we propose to examine the judgment of the learned trial Court with regard to the conviction of appellant No.1 for the offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.	ANALYSIS
The learned trial Court has believed the dying declaration (Exh.60) of the deceased and has come to the conclusion that appellant No.1 had caused death of the deceased.	ANALYSIS
To examine whether the finding given by the learned trial Court is right or wrong, it will be necessary to state in brief the evidence with regard to requisitioning the services of the Executive Magistrate and recording of dying declaration.	ANALYSIS
 12.  There is no dispute that the incident in question had occurred on 20th June, 2004.	ANALYSIS
The deceased was admitted in Government Hospital at Yavatmal on the same day.	ANALYSIS
Her statement was recorded by the P.W.1 Executive Magistrate on the same day.	ANALYSIS
It is also not in dispute that the First Information Report was registered at Ghatanji Police Station on 21st June, 2004.	ANALYSIS
It is also not in dispute that the deceased had died on 22nd June, 2004 and thereafter Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code was applied.	ANALYSIS
The Investigating Officer P.W.6Dipak Gotmare of Ghatanji Police Station had visited the spot immediately after the incident on 20th June, 2004.	ANALYSIS
He however had not registered any offence after his return to the Police Station from the spot.	ANALYSIS
 13.             P.W.6Dipak Gotmare has stated in his evidence that he had received information that Asha Hemant Chauriwal had set herself on fire.	ANALYSIS
 The circumstances involving recording of dying declaration and the dying declaration itself will have to be examined in the light of this statement of the Police Officer, who had received information of the incident, which was first in time.	ANALYSIS
 14.             P.W.1Pushpalata, the Executive Magistrate, has stated that she had received the memo from the police for recording dying declaration and she had visited Ward No.26 of Government Hospital.	ANALYSIS
She had recorded statement of the deceased Asha Hemant Chauriwal.	ANALYSIS
According to this witness, the Medical Officer had certified that the deceased was in a fit condition to make a statement.	ANALYSIS
The memo received by this witness is produced at Exh.59.	ANALYSIS
The Medical Officer, who had examined the deceased, has been examined as P.W.5.	ANALYSIS
P.W.5Dr	ANALYSIS
. Sarika Naik has stated that at the request of P.W.1Pushpalata, she had examined the deceased and had certified that the deceased was mentally competent to give her dying declaration.	ANALYSIS
The memo received by P.W.1Pushpalata is at Exh.59 and the certificate given by the Medical Officer is at Exh.96.	ANALYSIS
In her statement, which was reduced to writing by P.W.1Pushpalata, the deceased had stated before P.W.1 that she was being tortured at her matrimonial home and they had been constantly demanding money from her.	ANALYSIS
The deceased had also stated that on 20th June, 2004 she was set on fire by her husband.	ANALYSIS
She also wanted her husband to be punished for the offence committed by him.	ANALYSIS
In this regard, it is necessary to be stated here that the officer of Yavatmal Police, who had issued request letter to P.W.1Pushpalata for recording statement of the deceased, has not been examined.	ANALYSIS
The prosecution has also not examined the Police Constable who had carried request letter to P.W.1 Pushpalata.	ANALYSIS
It is also not clear from the evidence of P.W.1Pushpalata as to who had collected the dying declaration recorded by her at Exh.60.	ANALYSIS
There is no evidence at what time the dying declaration was collected from P.W.1 Pushpalata and in whose custody it was lying before it reached Ghatanji Police Station where a First Information Report was registered on the basis of the dying declaration carried by P.W.2Prakash.	ANALYSIS
In fact, it was the duty of the learned trial Court to examine whether the statement made by the deceased was voluntary and true.	ANALYSIS
The learned trial Court should have borne in mind that dying declaration has to be judged and appreciated in light of the surrounding circumstances.	ANALYSIS
 15.  In a latest judgment reported at 2012(3) SCALE 438 (MANU/SC/0212/2012) in the matter of Bhajju @ Karan Singh Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, the Hon'ble Supreme Court at Para No.12 has stated as under : "12.	PRE_RELIED
The law is wellsettled that a dying declaration is admissible in evidence and the admissibility is founded on the principle of necessity.	PRE_RELIED
A dying declaration, if found reliable, can form the basis of a conviction.	PRE_RELIED
A Court of facts is not excluded from acting upon an uncorroborated dying declaration for finding conviction.	PRE_RELIED
The dying declaration, as a piece of evidence, stands on the same footing as any other piece of evidence.	PRE_RELIED
It has to be judged and appreciated in light of the surrounding circumstances and its weight determined by reference to the principle governing the weighing of evidence.	PRE_RELIED
If in a given case a particular dying declaration suffers from any infirmity, either of its own or as disclosed by the other evidence adduced in the case or the circumstances coming to its notice, the Court may, as a rule of prudence, look for corroboration and if the infirmities are such as would render a dying declaration so infirm that it pricks the conscience of the Court, the same may be refused to be accepted as forming basis of the conviction."	PRE_RELIED
It is thus clear that the dying declaration can be basis for conviction without there being any corroboration.	ANALYSIS
However, it is necessary that it must enjoy full confidence of the Court.	ANALYSIS
To determine whether it enjoys full confidence of the Court or not, it is necessary to judge the dying declaration like any other piece of evidence.	ANALYSIS
The Hon'ble Supreme Court has said that it is to be judged and appreciated in light of the surrounding circumstances and its weight determined by reference to the principle governing the weighing of evidence.	ANALYSIS
 16.  The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Sharda Vs. State of Rajasthan reported at AIR 2010 SC 408 has said at Para 34 as under : "34.	PRE_RELIED
Though a dying declaration is entitled and is still recognized by law to be given greater weightage but it has also to be kept in mind that accused had no chance of cross examination.	PRE_RELIED
Such a right of crossexamination is essential for eliciting the truth as an obligation of oath.	PRE_RELIED
This is the reason, generally, the court insists that the dying declaration should be such which inspires full confidence of the court of its correctness.	PRE_RELIED
The court has to be on guard that such statement of deceased was not as a result of either tutoring, prompting or product of imagination.	PRE_RELIED
The court must be further satisfied that deceased was in a fit state of mind after a clear opportunity to observe and identify the assailants.	PRE_RELIED
Once the court is satisfied that the aforesaid requirement and also to the fact that declaration was true and voluntary, undoubtedly, it can base its conviction without any further corroboration.	PRE_RELIED
It is not an absolute rule of law that the dying declaration cannot be form the sole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated.	PRE_RELIED
     The rule requiring corroboration is merely a rule of prudence." 17.  	PRE_RELIED
In the present case, the prosecution has not given any explanation as to why did they fail to examine the Police Officer, who had issued request letter to the Executive Magistrate for recording dying declaration and at the same time why the Police Constable, who had carried the request letter, has also not been examined.	ANALYSIS
Non examination of these two witnesses by itself would not have been fatal to the prosecution case, had the other circumstances inspired confidence in our mind.	ANALYSIS
It is stated by P.W.1Pushpalata in her examinationinchief that relatives of the deceased were present in Burn Ward and she had requested a constable to ask all the relatives to withdraw themselves from the Burn Ward.	ANALYSIS
It has also come in the evidence of P.W.3Devidas and P.W.4Chandrakala that they had reached hospital before arrival of the Executive Magistrate.	ANALYSIS
The presence of relatives by itself also is no reason to come to the conclusion that the person giving the statement was tutored.	ANALYSIS
At the same time, it is to be borne in mind that primarily it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts.	ANALYSIS
The court is not only under obligation to examine the dying declaration but it is also under obligation to examine the circumstances in which the dying declaration was recorded.	ANALYSIS
 18.  In the present case, Police Officer P.W.6Dipak Gotmare has stated that he received information that deceased Asha Hemant Chauriwal had set herself on fire and he had reached the spot for drawing spot panchanama.	ANALYSIS
The contents of dying declaration are contrary to the information received by police which was first in time.	ANALYSIS
The prosecution has not been able to rule out the possibility of creating a false dying declaration at the instance of the relatives.	ANALYSIS
We are fortified our view due to certain facts stated by P.W.6 in his crossexamination.	ANALYSIS
P.W.6Dipak Gotmare, Investigating Officer, has stated in the crossexamination that he had not seized burnt pieces of clothes from the spot of occurrence as those were not found there.	ANALYSIS
 He had also not collected sample of soil from the spot of occurrence.	ANALYSIS
He did not find burnt pieces of clothes any where in the house.	ANALYSIS
As such we had requested the learned Additional Public Prosecutor to let us know from the evidence as to exactly where the incident had occurred.	ANALYSIS
After having gone through the evidence and the crime report including panchanama, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor has not been able to tell us as to what was the location where the deceased had sustained burn injuries.	ANALYSIS
 19.  The appellants and accused had given explanation in their statements under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which appears to be probable.	ANALYSIS
It is explained by the appellants and the other accused that the deceased had set herself on fire and had committed suicide.	ANALYSIS
 It is worth mentioning that P.W.2Prakash, who was working as Head Constable at Yavatmal Police Headquarters, has stated that he was posted at City Police Station, Yavatmal.	ANALYSIS
He had carried dying declaration of the deceased to Ghatanji Police Station on 21st June, 2004.	ANALYSIS
He had lodged his report, which was recorded as First Information Report Exh.78 at Ghatanji Police Station.	ANALYSIS
The statement of the deceased was recorded at about 5.45 p.m. on 20th June, 2004 at Yavatmal.	ANALYSIS
The statement of the deceased was a statement within the meaning of Section 157 of the Evidence Act.	ANALYSIS
It was not a confidential document.	ANALYSIS
An offence could have been registered at Yavatmal Police Station by giving No.'00/2004'.	ANALYSIS
In fact it is the practice in Maharashtra that whenever the First Information Report of cognizable offence is received by the Police Station with regard to the offence which had not occurred within the jurisdiction of the said police station, the First Information Report is recorded under '00' number of the particular year.	ANALYSIS
The said First Information Report is later on transferred to the police Station having jurisdiction over the place of offence.	ANALYSIS
As such there are a lot of mysterious circumstances which have remained unexplained.	ANALYSIS
These unexplained circumstances create a reasonable doubt in our mind as to the correctness of the dying declaration.	ANALYSIS
It need not be stated here that it is the duty of the Court to examine whether the dying declaration was voluntary and true.	ANALYSIS
In the present case, we doubt as to whether the statement reduced to writing by P.W.1Pushpalata produced at Exh.60 was statement of the deceased.	ANALYSIS
 20.  The evidence of parents of the deceased does not help in any manner as far as charge under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code is concerned.	ANALYSIS
The conviction recorded against appellant No.1 was purely based on the dying declaration of the deceased.	ANALYSIS
In view of our finding that there are many mysterious circumstances, which have remained unexplained and that the dying declaration of the deceased reduced to writing by P.W.1 Pushpalata does not appear to be genuine dying declaration, we are of the view that appellant No.1 should have been acquitted of the offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code.	ANALYSIS
 21.  As far as charge under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code is concerned, the conviction is mainly based on the letters produced by the parents of the deceased before the Investigating Officer.	ANALYSIS
P.W.3Devidas has stated in his evidence that he had handed over letters received from the deceased.	ANALYSIS
He has identified signature of the deceased.	ANALYSIS
P.W.6Dipak Gotmare, the Investigating Officer, in his evidence, has stated that he had seized letters under the panchanama Exh.63.	ANALYSIS
The letters seized under the said panchanama were exhibited at Exhs.82 to 90.	ANALYSIS
However, there is no further investigation with regard to the letters.	ANALYSIS
The admitted signatures of the deceased were not collected and opinion of the expert was not sought by the Investigating Officer.	ANALYSIS
Even there does not appear to be attempt on the part of Investigating Officer to verify the genuineness of the letters.	ANALYSIS
In the circumstances, in our opinion, the conviction recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge for the offence punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code is also not sustainable.	ANALYSIS
Though the Investigating Officer has stated in his evidence that he made efforts to collect natural handwriting of the deceased, but he could not do so, he has not explained as to what steps he had taken to get natural handwriting of the deceased.	ANALYSIS
 22.  As such the learned trial Court should not have based conviction of the appellants for the offence punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian penal Code only on the basis of the letters produced by father of the deceased, which according to him were written to him by his daughter.	ANALYSIS
The learned trial Court should have asked for better evidence or at least proof of the fact that the letters were in handwriting of the deceased.	ANALYSIS
The investigation, in our opinion, was carried out very shabbily.	ANALYSIS
Either there was sabotage or a false case has been prepared under the pressure of parents of the deceased.	ANALYSIS
We are aware that the mistake on the part of the Investigating Officer should not by itself be a ground for acquittal.	ANALYSIS
If the acceptable evidence is sufficient to record conviction, the mistakes committed by the Investigating Officer should not come in the way of convicting the accused of the offence proved against him.	ANALYSIS
However, in the present case, the mistakes committed by the Investigating Officer, deliberately or negligently, have adversely affected the prosecution case to such an extent that we find it highly risky to sustain the conviction recorded by the learned trial Judge against the appellants.	RATIO
We have come to the conclusion that the judgment is not sustainable and it needs to be set aside.	RATIO
Both the appeals deserve to be allowed.	RPC
Hence, we pass the following order.	RPC
 i) These criminal appeals are allowed and the conviction and sentence of the appellants is hereby quashed and set aside and the appellants are acquitted of the offences with which they were charged and convicted.	RPC
 ii) Fine if paid by the appellants be refunded to them.	RPC
 iii) Since the appellant Hemant Kawadu Chauriwal in Criminal Appeal No.53 of 2007 is in Jail, he be released forthwith, if not required in any other offence.	RPC
 iv) Bailbonds of the appellant Sau. Vachhalla Kawadu Chauriwal stand cancelled.	RPC
