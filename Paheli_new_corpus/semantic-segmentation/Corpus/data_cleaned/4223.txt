COMMON ORDERS ON BAIL APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 438 & 439 OF CR.P.C.	PREAMBLE
 Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013 who are arrayed as Accused Nos.3 and 4, while Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 who are arrayed as Accused Nos.1 and 2 in the F.I.R., have filed anticipatory and regular bail petitions respectively seeking their enlargement on bail in Cr.No.271 of 2013 of Nanjangud Rural Police Station, registered for the offences made punishable under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, 1956.	FAC
 2.  In brief, case according to Prosecution, as set out in the Case Diary is as follows:	FAC
The assistant Superintendent of Police, Nanjangud Sub Division has suo-moto lodged complaint with P.S.H.O., of Nanjangud Rural Police Station alleging that on 21.11.2013, at 1.30 p.m. when he was in the office, he received a credible information that in Malabar Plaza Hotel situated at Elachagere Bore Village, certain immoral activities were going on.	FAC
Complainant immediately thereafter secured his staff and panchas to conduct raid and proceeded in their Jeep to Elachagere Bore Village.	FAC
When they conducted raid on the hotel, they found the Petitioners in compromising position with the Prostitutes.	FAC
On inquiry with them, they revealed their names as Prakash and Kumar.	FAC
The complainant arrested the Petitioners, seized cell phones from them and produced them before the learned Magistrate who remanded them to Judicial Custody.	FAC
The Petitioners moved bail application before the learned Magistrate which came to be rejected on the premise that Petitioners were caught red handed along with the victims.	FAC
Investigation is yet to be completed.	FAC
 3.  On the strength of said complaint, a case in Cr.No.271 of 2013, for the offences punishable under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of Immoral Traffic Prevention Act 1956, came to be registered.	FAC
 4.  Petitioner in Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 have voluntarily surrendered before the learned Magistrate, who in turn remanded them to Judicial Custody.	RLC
Hence, Petitioners filed the bail petition and the Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013, being apprehensive of their arrest, filed the bail petition, on the following amongst other common grounds: Petitioners are innocent of the offences alleged against them and they have been falsely implicated in the case.	FAC
Petitionerd in Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 have voluntarily surrendered before the Trial Court on 21.11.2013 and till this day, they are in Judicial Custody.	FAC
Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 being Cook in the said hotel were not involved in any of the activities as alleged in the complaint.	FAC
They are neither the owners nor customers of the hotel.	FAC
Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013 are not running any hotel and they are agriculturists by profession.	FAC
Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 are residents of Madrahalli Village, Gundlupet Taluk, Chamarajanagar District and the Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013 are residents of Nanjangud Taluk, Mysore District and having movable and immovable properties.	FAC
They are ready to abide by the conditions that may be imposed by the Court and ready to offer surety to the satisfaction of the Court.	FAC
On all these amongst other grounds, Petitioners in both petitions prayed for their enlargement on bail.	FAC
 5.  The learned Public Prosecutor has filed similar objections, reiterating the averments made in the complaint.	ANALYSIS
He has contended that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Petitioners have committed the above said offences.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013 are absconding since the date of offence.	ARG_RESPONDENT
All the Petitioners are influential persons.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Investigation is at preliminary stage.	ARG_RESPONDENT
If Petitioners are released on bail, they may abscond, may tamper prosecution witnesses and may hamper investigation.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Hence, Petitioners prayed for rejection of both the bail petitions.	ARG_RESPONDENT
6.  Heard the arguments of learned Counsels appearing on behalf of the Petitioners and learned Public Prosecutor. 7.	NONE
The following points would arise for consideration: 1.	ISSUE
Whether Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013 are entitled to anticipatory bail as prayed in their petition?	ISSUE
 2. Whether Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.179 of 2013 are entitled to bail as prayed in their petition?	ISSUE
 3. What order?	ISSUE
 8.  My answer to the above points is as follows: Point No.1 :   In the AFFIRMATIVE Point No.2 :   In the AFFIRMATIVE Point No.3 :   As per final order for the following: REASONS Point Nos.1 and 2 9.  Learned Public Prosecutor has filed only the statement of objections.	ANALYSIS
He has not made available to this Court the case diary relating to the investigation thus far done by the Investigating Officer.	ANALYSIS
 10. However, learned Counsel for the Petitioners has produced order sheet of the Trial Court, F.I.R, remand application etc., Perused these documents and also perused the grounds urged by the Petitioners in their petitions and their statement of objections.	ANALYSIS
The contents of the F.I.R is quite clear that the Petitioners were caught red handed while they were in compromising position with the victim ladies.	ANALYSIS
The learned Counsel for the Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 would contend that Petitioners are Cook in the Hotel.	ARG_PETITIONER
The learned Counsel for the Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013 would contend that Petitioners are not the owners of the hotel nor they are running the hotel and they are agriculturists by profession and they had nothing to do with the alleged brothel being carried on in the hotel.	ARG_PETITIONER
But, I am not in agreement with the submission of the learned Counsel for the obvious reason that the allegations in the complaint and statement of witnesses would reveal that the Petitioners were found in compromising position with two ladies.	ANALYSIS
11. At this stage, this Court refrains itself from making entire comment upon the rival contention and the merits of the case.	ANALYSIS
Suffice it to say that the alleged offences are not punishable with death or imprisonment for life and are all triable by the Court of Magistrate.	ANALYSIS
Maximum punishment for the said offences is only 7 years.	ANALYSIS
Fact that the Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013 are permanent residents of Nanjangud Town, Mysore District and the Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 are permanent residents of Madrahalli Village, Gundlupet Taluk, Chamarajanagar District, owning substantial movable and immovable properties and are deep rooted in society is not disputed.	ANALYSIS
 12. Having regard to the nature and magnitude of the offence, I am of the view that Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013 could be given benefit of anticipatory bail and Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 could be given benefit of regular bail by imposing certain conditions.	RATIO
I have accordingly answered the above Point Nos.1 and 2 in the AFFIRMATIVE.	RATIO
 Point No.3 13. In the result and for the reasons stated above, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER Petition in Cr.Mis.Nos.1761 of 2013 and Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 filed by the Petitioners under Section 438 and 439 of Cr.P.C. respectively stands ACCEPTED.	RPC
 The Respondent / Police are directed to enlarge the Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1761 of 2013, on bail in the event of their arrest in Cr.No.271 of 2013 on their executing personal bond in a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- [Rupees one lakh only] each with two sureties for like sum.	RPC
The Petitioners in Cr.Mis.No.1789 of 2013 is enlarged on bail on their executing personal bond in a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- [Rupees one lakh only] each with two sureties for the like sum subject to following: CONDITIONS	RPC
