THIS PETITION IS FILED UNDER ARTICLES 226 AND227 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA PRAYING TO:a. SET-ASIDE ORDER OF RESPONDENT NO.1 PASSED ON 15.06.2015 IN BEARING REFERRING NO.F.NO.01/92/171/ 23/AM-16/PC-VI/100 AT ANNEXURE-A AND, b. DIRECT THE RESPONDENT NO.2 TO CONSIDER THE APPLICATION DATED 27.07.2O15 PENDING BEFORE IT, WHICH IS PRODUCED AT ANNEXURE-F AND ETC, THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING: ORDER	PREAMBLE
This writ petition is listed for consideration of I.A/2018 for vacating the interim order granted by this Court.	NONE
As the writ petition lies in a narrow compass, with the consent of the counsels, it is taken up for disposal.	NONE
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned counsel Sri. S. N. Rajendra for respondents No.1 to 3. 2.	NONE
The petitioner is before this Court being aggrieved by the order dated 15.06.2015 passed in F.No.01/92/71/23/AM-16/PC-VI/100, whereby the Appellate Authority has been pleased to upheld the order in revision passed by the Development Commissioner, Chchin Special Economic Zone (CSEZ), Bengaluru dated 08.01.2013.	NONE
 3. The facts in brief are that the petitioner was issued a letter of permission dated 08.10.2007, whereby the petitioner's unit was permitted to operate as an Export Oriented Unit in lieu of the scheme as envisaged under the Foreign Trade policy, 2004-09 in respect of the undertaking established by the petitioner in plot No.224-B, KIADB, Belur, Dharwad, Karnataka - 580 011 for the purpose of manufacturing 6-12" Cups and Cones with an annual capacity of 1,05,000 numbers.	FAC
 4. The Letter of Permission was granted subject to certain conditions imposed therein and the standard conditions as contained in the Annexure.	FAC
Under the letter of permission, in paragraph 2, certain conditions were imposed and certain benefits were also extended and the unit was required to meet certain obligations in lieu of the benefits conferred upon it under the Letter of Permission.	FAC
One of the conditions, more specifically the condition imposed under Clause-(i) of paragraph 2 mandates that the unit shall export its entire production, excluding rejects, for a period of five years from the date of commencement of commercial production.	FAC
Though several other stipulations are imposed under the said letter of permission, this Court is of the considered opinion that the writ petition could be disposed of on the said short point alone, in other words the conditions referred above.	FAC
 5. It is contended by the learned counsel for the respondents that the petitioner have not commenced production of their own and was merely carrying out job works for entities in the domestic tariff area or the local market and the petitioner had not met any of its export commitments or obligations, though it had availed of duty free imports and also exemption under Section 10(B) of the Income Tax Act.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Under Clause (vi) of paragraph 2, the Letter of Permission was made valid for a period of three years and the petitioner was required to implement the project within that period and was also required to commence commercial production.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Clause 6 reads as under: "vi.	ANALYSIS
This Letter of Permission is valid for 3 years from its date of issue within which you should implement the project and commence commercial       production  and  would automatically lapse if an application for the extension of validity is not made before the end of the said period.	ANALYSIS
Date of commencement of commercial production shall be intimated to the Development Commissioner, Cochin Special Economic Zone."	ANALYSIS
6. In view of the perceived non-compliance of the obligations arising under the Foreign Trade Policy and the obligations arising out of the Letter of Permission and the standard conditions, the Original Authority issued a show cause notice dated 25.04.2012.	ANALYSIS
The same was replied to by the petitioner vide reply dated 06.07.2012.	ANALYSIS
In paragraph 2 of the reply it is contended as under: "2. We wish to submit that the Cups and Cones in unfinished condition received from various manufacturers are inspected/checked, cleaned, pre-heated, carburized, washed, inspected, tested and thereafter dispatched to M/s.	ANALYSIS
Timken India Manufacturers Private Limited, a SEZ Unit.	ANALYSIS
The Cups and Cones are thus subjected to carburizing or heat treatment, through a series of processes, and the goods of specified quality after treatment and testing are cleared so that they could be used as a part/component in the bearings for automobiles.	ANALYSIS
The SEZ Unit uses these components for manufacture of bearing falling under CHH 8482 0000 and exports the same."	ANALYSIS
 7. From a bare reading of the reply and particularly paragraph 2 of the reply, it is apparent that the petitioner has not fulfilled it's export obligations as required under the Foreign Trade policy, under which the Letter of Permission came to be issued, thereby conferring upon the petitioner certain benefits in the form as that were available to an export oriented unit.	ANALYSIS
 8. The Original Authority afforded an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner and thereafter in the light of all the records and material available was pleased to pass the order in original, whereby the Letter of Permission came to be cancelled with immediate effect and penalty of Rs.5,00,000/- was imposed on account of non-fulfillment of the obligations arising under the Letter of Permission and aggrieved by that, the petitioner has preferred an appeal.	ANALYSIS
The Appellate Court after going through the finding of fact rendered by the order of the Original Authority has categorically held that the petitioner has not carried out any exports and the job works carried out by the petitioners do not amount to deemed export or that it cannot be construed to be deemed exports.	ANALYSIS
Accordingly, it rejected the appeal.	ANALYSIS
Hence, the petitioner is before this Court.	ANALYSIS
9. There is no denying fact that the petitioner has failed to comply with any of the obligations that have been imposed on it under the Letter of Permission.	RATIO
The Letter of Permission, treating the unit as an Export Oriented Unit, being a conditional one subject to the condition imposed under Clause (vi) of paragraph 2 of the letter, this Court does not find any error or perversity in the reasoning assigned by the Original Authority or the Appellate Authority to arrive at the conclusion rendered by them.	RATIO
No material is demonstrated or placed before this Court by the petitioner for this Court to conclude contrary to the finding of fact rendered by the Original Authority as confirmed by the Appellate Authority.	RATIO
 In that view of the matter, the petition being devoid of merit stands rejected.	RPC
