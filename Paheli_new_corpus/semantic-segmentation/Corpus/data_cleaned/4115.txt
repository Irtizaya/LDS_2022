THESE APPEALS HAVING BEEN HEARD ANDRESERVED ON 25.02.2019 AND COMING ON FORPRONOUNCEMENT OF JUDGMENT THIS DAY, B.M.SHYAM PRASAD J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING: JUDGMENT	PREAMBLE
The appellant  revenue has, in these appeals under Section 35G of the Central Excise Act, 1944, impugned the Final Order dated 20.02.2018 in No.20304-20313 of 2018 by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, South Zonal Bench, Bengaluru (for short, `Appellate Tribunal').	FAC
The Appellate Tribunal by this impugned order has allowed the respondent's appeal against the common order dated 21.9.2017 by the Commissioner of Central Taxes (Appeals-1) in Appeal Nos. 1091 to 1100 of 2017.	RLC
The appellant- revenue has proposed the following as substantial questions in these appeals: "1.	ISSUE
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case CESTAT was correct in merely setting aside the impugned order (Commissioner  Appeals) and allowing the appeal without assigning any reasons and recording any finding on the controversy and recorded perverse finding?	ISSUE
 2. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, CESTAT was correct in allowing the appeal by giving reference to the judgments dealing with the interest under section 11BB of the Central Excise Act, without recording any finding on the eligibility of interest under section 11BB of the Central excise Act, the manner of computation of the interest, period of commencement of interest, the quantum of refund on which interest to be quantified, in the absence of such an issue was considered either by the adjudicating authority or by the Commissioner-Appeals and recorded perverse finding? 3.	ISSUE
Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, CESTAT failed to record a finding regarding the quantum of refund the assessee would be eligible in view of the specific dispute on the quantum and the consequential interest on such quantum of refund?"	ISSUE
2. The present appeals arise in the following circumstances: The respondent offered Information Technology Software Services, as defined under the Finances Act, 1994, to its foreign clients under the Service Agreement concluded with them.	FAC
The respondent furnished FIRCs, along with Export Invoices, to establish that it realized export proceeds in convertible foreign currency.	FAC
The respondent filed its returns in Form ST-3.	FAC
Thereafter, the respondent filed Ten claims with the Assistant Commissioner, Division C, Bengaluru for refund of Unutilized CENVAT Credit for the period between July 2012 to June 2015 under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004.	FAC
The Assistant Commissioner, Division C, Bengaluru examined the respondent's claim for refund, and vide its separate orders dated 21.6.2017 allowed such claims for refund as provided for under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules 2004 read with Notification No.27/2012-CE(NT) dated 18.6.2012 (for short, `CENVAT Credit Rules & Notification dated 18.6.2012').	FAC
However, the Assistant Commissioner, Division C, Bangalore did not grant interest for the delay in refund.	FAC
 3. The respondent, being aggrieved by these orders, insofar as refusal of interest for the delay in the refund, filed Ten appeals before the Commissioner of Central Taxes (Appeals-1), who dismissed these Ten Appeals in No. 1091-1100 of 2017 holding that the respondent would not be entitled for payment of interest because the provision for payment of interest on delayed refund under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act, 1944 would apply only where there has been excess payment or collection of duty.	FAC
The Commissioner of Central Taxes (Appeals-1) emphasized that the principle for payment of interest for the delay in refund contained in Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act, 1944 cannot be extrapolated into Schema for refund of Unutilized CENVAT Credit, as such Schema is nothing more than a facilitative mechanism provided to the exporter to convert the unutilized credit lying in its account into cash.	FAC
The fundamental difference between the Schema for the unutilized CENVAT Credit and refund of the excess duty paid or collected, the Commissioner of Central Taxes emphasized, is that in the former the unutilized credit lies in the assessee's account unlike in the case of excess payment of duty that would be with the State Exchequer; as the State Exchequer would have the benefit of excess payment of duty, the provision for payment of interest is provided under Section 11BB of the Customs Act.	FAC
4. The respondent being aggrieved by this order, preferred an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal, and the Appellate Tribunal, by its impugned final order dated 20.2.2018, set aside the common order in Appeals in Nos. 1091-1100 of 2017 holding that the appellate order by the Commissioner of Central Taxes (Appeals-1) cannot be sustained.	RLC
The Appellate Tribunal relied upon the decision of the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in Commissioner of Central Excise vs. Reliance Industries Ltd., reported in 2010(259) ELT 356 (GUJARAT).	RLC
The Appellate Tribunal also observed that the decision of the High of Gujarat was challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court but such challenge was unsuccessful.	RLC
 5. The learned counsel for the appellant - revenue argued that payment of interest on delayed refund is payable under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (for short, the `Act'), if the claim for refund is under Section 11B of the Act.	ARG_PETITIONER
However, the present claim by the respondent is for the refund of the unutilized CENVAT credit under the CENVAT Credit Rules & Notification dated 18.6.2012.	ARG_PETITIONER
As such, the Department/Revenue cannot be called upon to pay interest for delay in refund of the unutilized CENVAT credit under Section 11BB of Act.	ARG_PETITIONER
The learned counsel elaborated that the claim for refund under Section 11B of the Act is in respect of excess duty paid or collected.	ARG_PETITIONER
If the excess duty is paid or collected, then upon receipt of an application as provided under Section 11B of the Act, the interest on delay in refund is payable under Section 11BB of the Act provided that excess amount is not refunded within three months from the date of receipt of such application under Section 11B(1) of the Act.	ARG_PETITIONER
Under Section 11 BB of the Act, the interest on the excess duty paid or collected is payable from the date of receipt of application till the date of refund of such duty at such rate which is not below 5% and not exceeding 30% p.a. as is fixed by the Central Government by Notification in the Official Gazette.	ARG_PETITIONER
However, under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules & Notification dated 18.6.2012, a manufacturer or a provider of output service is allowed refund of such unutilized CENVAT credit subject to such safeguards, conditions and limitations as may be specified.	ARG_PETITIONER
The unutilized CENVAT Credit lies in the account of the assessee and it is therefore distinct and separate from the excess duty paid or collected which would stand to the credit of the exchequer.	ARG_PETITIONER
As such, no recourse should be had to the provisions of 11BB of the Act to award interest in the event there is any delay in refund of unutilized CENVAT credit.	ARG_PETITIONER
6. The learned counsel for the appellant - revenue argued that the Appellate Tribunal has not recorded any finding on the respondent's eligibility to interest under section 11BB of the Act, if interest is payable, the manner of computation of interest, the period of commencement for computing interest and the quantum of refund on which interest is to be quantified.	ARG_PETITIONER
As such, the impugned order is perfunctory and contrary to law.	ARG_PETITIONER
 7. The learned Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, submitted that this question whether interest on delayed refund of unutilized CENVAT credit as contemplated under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules & Notification dated 18.6.2012 would be permissible under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act has been considered by the High Court of Madras as well as the High Court of Gujarat.	ARG_RESPONDENT
In fact, the appellant  revenue impugned the decision of the High Court of Gujarat before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, but the appellant  revenue did not succeed in the said appeal.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Therefore, the appellant  revenue cannot re- agitate the issue again.	ARG_RESPONDENT
 8. The learned counsel further contended that the manner of computation of interest is also settled in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ranbaxy Laboratories vs. Union of India reported in 2011(273)ELT 3(SC) wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has declared that the liability of the Revenue to pay interest under Section 11BB of the Act commences from the date of expiry of three months from the date of receipt of application for refund under Section 11B(i) of the Act and not on the expiry of the three months period from the date on which the order of refund is made.	ARG_RESPONDENT
There cannot be any quarrel over the quantum of refund in view of the orders of the Assistant Commissioner, Division C, Bengaluru,	ARG_RESPONDENT
Therefore, the impugned order does not suffer from any irregularity or perversity.	ARG_RESPONDENT
 9. The rival submissions are examined in the light of the decisions by the High Court of Gujarat as well as High Court of Madras.	ANALYSIS
The High Court of Gujarat in the case of Commissioner, Central Excise vs Reliance Industries Limited supra, while considering a similar canvas against the payment of interest on delayed refunds under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act, in terms of the obligation to refund under Rule 5 of the CENVET Credit Rules & Notification dated 18.6.2012, did not accept the canvas on behalf of the revenue that the scheme for refund of unutilized CENVAT Credit is a special beneficial scheme with self contained procedure providing for the manner and method of its implementation, and hence any refund claimed under the Rules would be governed only by the provisions of the Scheme and the general provisions of Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act cannot be resorted to.	PRE_RELIED
The High Court of Gujarat concluded that the CENVAT credit is nothing but duty paid by the supplier of inputs which are dutiable goods manufactured by the supplier or dutiable services rendered by the service provider; when such goods/services are utilized for further manufacture or providing service, which are dutiable, the manufactured goods or service provided carry the duty paid by the Supplier of inputs as a component of its price/value.	PRE_RELIED
Hence, the duty payable on the ultimately manufactured goods/services rendered stands reduced to the extent of duty already paid on the inputs.	PRE_RELIED
Thus, the duty paid on inputs by the supplier has already been actually received by the exchequer.	PRE_RELIED
Therefore, there is a basic fallacy in the argument by the revenue that refund of unutilized CENVAT credit is different from excess duty paid or collected as contemplated under Section 11B of the Act.	ANALYSIS
As such, the High Court of Gujarath held that when there is delay in sanctioning the refund under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules & Notification dated 18.6.2012, the provisions of Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act would be clearly attracted.	ANALYSIS
 10. The High Court of Madras, which was considering allowing interest on the delayed refund of unutilized credit under the MODVAT Credit Scheme, has also concluded that the MODVAT Credit taken was nothing but payment of duty which would be available to the assessee on the assessee paying duty on inputs at the time of clearance of final bills and therefore, there is statutory obligation on the part of the appellant  revenue under Section 11BB of the Act to pay interest for the delayed refund of the duty.	ANALYSIS
 11. The learned counsel for the appellant  revenue is unable to persuade this court to hold that the obligation to refund unutilized CEVANT Credit under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules & Notification dated 18.6.2012 is distinct and separate from the obligation under Section 11B of the Act in the light of the reasoning in the aforesaid decisions.	ANALYSIS
This Court concurs with the reasons assigned in the aforesaid decisions to hold that the revenue would be obliged to pay under interest for the delayed refund as contemplated under Section 11BB of the Act even for the delayed refund of the Unutilized CENVAT credit under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules & Notification dated 18.6.2012.	RATIO
        There is also considerable force in the submissions on behalf of the respondent that in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court Ranbaxy Laboratories vs. Union of India reported in 2011(273)ELT 3(SC) that there cannot be any dispute about the liability of the Revenue to pay interest under Section 11BB of the Act commencing from the date of expiry of three months from the date of receipt of application for refund under Section 11B(i) of the Act.	RATIO
The Appellate Tribunal has referred to this decision in its impugned order.	RATIO
 Similarly, in view of the orders of the Assistant Commissioner, Division  C, Bangalore, which has remained unchallenged as regards the quantum of refund of unutilized CENVAT credit, there cannot be any lis even as regards the quantum.	RATIO
 12. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, this court is of the considered opinion that no substantial questions arise for consideration, and the appeals are dismissed accordingly.	RPC
No costs.	RPC
13. In view of dismissal of the appeals, IA No.2 of 2018 does not survive for consideration and the same is dismissed.	RPC
