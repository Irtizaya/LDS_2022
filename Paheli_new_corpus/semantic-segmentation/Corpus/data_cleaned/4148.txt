HEADNOTE:	PREAMBLE
The Respondent, a licencee under floe Karnataka Excise Actfor selling liquor at an approved shop, flied a Writ Peti-tion before the High Court challenging the vires of Section23(d) of the Mysore Excise Act, 1965 and Rule 8(1) of theKarnataka Excise (Sale of Indian and Foreign Liquors) Rules,1968 as being beyond the legislative competence of theState.	PREAMBLE
The High Court negatived the contention of the Respond-ent in respect of Section 23(d) of the Act but held thatRule 8(1) authorising tihe levy of licence fee for retailshop was without authority of law and dircted refund of thelevy collected for three years prior to the filing of tiWritPetition.       	PREAMBLE
Aggrieved by the High Court's decision, the appellant-State has preferred the present appeal by special leave.	PREAMBLE
Dismissing the appeal, this Court,       HELD:	PREAMBLE
The High Court rightly did not accept the chal-lenge to Section 23(d) of the Mysore Excise Act, 1965.	PREAMBLE
Whatis authorised under Section 23(d) is imposition of a fee oflicence in respect of manufacture or sale of any excisablearticles.	PREAMBLE
Rule 8(1) of the Karnataka Excise (Sale of Iadion& Foreign Liquors) Rules, 1968 has obviously gone beyond theenabling provision in the section by requiring a licence feeto be paid for the premises where the licensed shop islocated.	PREAMBLE
Such a fee would not have the support of Section23(d).	PREAMBLE
It is unnecessary to refer to precedents for supportfor this conclusion.	PREAMBLE
It may be possible for the Legisla-ture to make a statutory provision for a liicence fee of thetype contemplated under the Rules but without authority ofthe statute a rule of this type should not have been made.[702E-F]	NONE

The High Court did not accept the contention of the respondent in 'regard to s. 23 but held that Rule 8(1)-authorising the 'levy of a licence fee for the retail off shop was without authority of law.	RLC
 Section 23(d), as far as relevant, provides: "23. Ways of levying such duties--	STA
Subject to such Rules regulating the time, place and manner, as may be prescribed, excise duty and countervailing duty under section 22 shall be levied in one or more of the follow- ing ways, as may be prescribed, namely:                         (a) .............                         (aa) ......................                         (b) ..........................                         (c)............................

What is authorised under s. 23(d) is imposition of a fee of licence in respect of manufacture or sale of any excisable articles.	ANALYSIS
Rule 8(1) has obviously gone beyond the enabling provision in the section by requir- ing a licence fee to be paid for the premises where the licence shop is located.	ANALYSIS
Such a fee would not have the support of s. 23(d).	ANALYSIS
It is unnecessary to refer to prece- dents for support for this conclusion.	ANALYSIS
It may be possible for the Legislature to make a statutory provision for a licence fee of the type contemplated under the Rules but without authority of the statute a rule of the type impugned should not have been made.	RATIO
