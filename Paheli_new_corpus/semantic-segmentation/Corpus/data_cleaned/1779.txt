FAC
On the other hand, the learned Public Prosecutor has resisted the aforesaid bail petitions of the petitioners in all the 4 cases by filing his separate objections and prayed to dismiss the same.	FAC
 3  Crl.Mis.Nos.1857,1817,1869 & 1910/14 3.	NONE
Since all the petitions have arisen out of the same Crime Number, all the 4 cases are clubbed and I proceed to pass common order in Crl.Mis.No.1857/2014 by clubbing Crl.Mis.No.1817/2014, Crl.Mis.No.1869/2014 and Crl.Mis.No.1910/2014.	FAC
4. Heard the arguments of both the sides. 5.	NONE

 2. Whether the petitioners in Crl.Mis.No.1817/2014, Crl.Mis.No.1869/2014 and Crl.Mis.No.1910/2014 are entitled to be granted regular bail under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C.?	ISSUE
3. What Order?	RPC
 6. My findings on the aforesaid Points are held as under: Point No.1 : In the Negative Point No.2 : In the Negative Point No.3 : As per my final order below, for the following: : R e a s o n s : Points-1 and 2:- 7.	FAC
Perused the petitions, FIR, written complaint, C.D. and other materials placed before me.	ANALYSIS
They reveal that, on 27-09-2014 at 6.00 p.m., the Complainant was returning to home by walk.	FAC
On the way, near the land of one Rajeshekar and Thammegowda, his brother by name K.S.Mahadeva was murdered by accused-1 to 9 named in the 4 written complaint and FIR.	FAC
Said accused had murdered Mahadeva by firing a bullet at him and also by assaulting him with a chopper.	FAC
There was a land dispute between the deceased, Complainant on one side and accused persons on another side.	FAC
Earlier to this incident, the accused had attempted to kill the Complainant for two times and two separate cases were registered against them for the offence punishable under Section 307 of the I.P.C.	FAC
The said cases are pending for consideration before FTC, Hunsur.	FAC
Since they had a threat to their lives, they had prayed for providing a Gunman to them.	FAC
Inspite of it, police did not provided the security to them.	FAC
The accused in order to destroy the evidence have murdered his brother Mahadeva.	FAC
He is also a witness in the said two cases registered for the offence punishable under Section 307 of the I.P.C.	FAC
The accused also have intended to murder him.	FAC
One Santhosh, son of his sister has witnessed the incident in question and informed the same to the members of the family.	FAC
Himself, his wife Shilpa, Sannappa, Parashurama have seen accused-1 to 9 referred in the complaint and FIR after the incident while running away by holding Chopper and Gun in their hands.	FAC
So, on the basis of the complaint filed by the Complainant, the respondent/police have registered a case in Crime No.260/2014 against the accused-1 to 9 for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 144, 147, 148, 341, 302, 149 of I.P.C. and under Sections 3, 24, 25 of Arms act, 1959. 8.	FAC
Petitioners-1 to 3 of Crl.Mis.No.1869/2014 are the accused-1, 3 and 4 named in the complaint and FIR.	FAC
The Petitioners-1 and 2 of Crl.Mis.No.1910/2014 are accused No.5 named in the FIR and complaint and accused No.13 is named in the Remand Application respectively.	FAC
The Petitioner of Crl.Mis.No.1817/2014 is the accused 5  Crl.Mis.Nos.1857,1817,1869 & 1910/14 No.14 named in the Remand Application.	FAC
The names of Petitioners-1 and 2 of Crl.Mis.No.1857/2014 are not appearing either in the written complaint or in the FIR or in the Remand application.	FAC
All the Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1817/2014, 1869/2014 and 1910/2014 are in judicial custody.	FAC
9. Under the said facts and circumstances of the case, the Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1817/2014, 1869/2014 and 1910/2014 have filed separate bail applications under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C.praying to gram them regular bail.	FAC
The Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1857/2014 apprehending their arrest by the Respondent/police in the aforesaid crime have filed the bail petition under Section 438 of the Cr.P.C. praying to grant them anticipatory bail.	FAC
 10. It is contended by the Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1857/2014 that they are innocents and law abiding citizens.	ARG_PETITIONER
They have not committed the alleged offences.	ARG_PETITIONER
Their names are not found in the FIR.	ARG_PETITIONER
Inspite of it, the Respondent/police are trying to arrest them just to harass and cause inconvenience by detaining them in their illegal custody.	ARG_PETITIONER
The 1st Petitioner is a senior citizen suffering from old age ailments.	ARG_PETITIONER
The 2nd Petitioner is a married woman.	ARG_PETITIONER
They are the permanent residents of Kogilavadi village.	ARG_PETITIONER
They are the agriculturists having landed properties.	ARG_PETITIONER
They have grown crops in their lands.	ARG_PETITIONER
The 1st Petitioner is suffering from ill health.	ARG_PETITIONER
They hail from respectable family.	ARG_PETITIONER
There is no allegation against them in the complaint.	ARG_PETITIONER
They are ready and willing to abide by the terms and conditions that would be imposed by this Court.	ARG_PETITIONER
So they prayed to grant them anticipatory bail.	ARG_PETITIONER
6 11. It is contended by the Petitioner of Crl.Mis.No.1817/2014 that on perusal of the written complaint of the Complainant, it goes to show that the Complainant is not an eye witness to the incident.	ARG_PETITIONER
It further reveals that, one Santhosh is an eye witness to the incident.	ARG_PETITIONER
The wife of the Complainant Shilpa, Sannappa and Parashuram have seen these accused who were running away from that place by holding deadly weapons.	ARG_PETITIONER
The Remand Application dated 15-10-2014 reveals that the statement of Santhosh, Swamy, Parashuram, Shilpashri, Shanthi, Prema and Shankarappa have been recorded and in the said statements, it is stated that the murder has been committed in order to destroy the evidence as the cases pertaining to attempt to commit an offence of murder are put on trial.	ARG_PETITIONER
If the said statements are perused, it goes to show that, Santhosh is not an eye witness to the incident.	ARG_PETITIONER
The witnesses have not seen the accused persons running away from that place.	ARG_PETITIONER
Recording of statement of these witnesses has not been mentioned in the earlier Remand Application.	ARG_PETITIONER
So, it goes to show that a false complaint has been filed on account of past ill will.	ARG_PETITIONER
The Petitioner was the resident of Kogilavadi village.	ARG_PETITIONER
After the marriage, he is staying in B.R.Kaval village, the village of his wife since 4 to 5 years.	ARG_PETITIONER
It is 20 kms away from Kogilavadi village.	ARG_PETITIONER
There is an allegation in the written complaint only against 9 persons.	ARG_PETITIONER
Nowhere it is stated in the complaint that others are also involved in the commission of the offence.	ARG_PETITIONER
His name is included in this case only as he is the friend of accused No.1-Papegowda.	ARG_PETITIONER
The statement of Basavaraju and Ponnappa have been recorded at the time of drawing inquest mahazar.	ARG_PETITIONER
Said witnesses have not stated as to his involvement in the commission of alleged offences.	ARG_PETITIONER
Said inquest mahazar reveals that only 9 persons are involved in the commission of the alleged 7  Crl.Mis.Nos.1857,1817,1869 & 1910/14 offences.	ARG_PETITIONER
He is in judicial custody since 15-10-2014.	ARG_PETITIONER
The records reveals that a chopper and clothes have been seized at the instance of the Petitioner.	ARG_PETITIONER
But the remand report does not reveal that said clothes were blood stained.	ARG_PETITIONER
So also, there is no evidence as to the chopper seized was blood stained.	ARG_PETITIONER
There is no acceptable evidence before this Court to connect the Petitioner in this case.	ARG_PETITIONER
His parents are residing at Kogilavadi village.	ARG_PETITIONER
He used to come to Kogilavadi village often to see his parents.	ARG_PETITIONER
He is residing at B.R.Kaval village along with his wife and children.	ARG_PETITIONER

So he prayed to grant him regular bail.	ARG_PETITIONER
 12. It is contended by the Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1869/2014 that, they are innocents of the alleged offences.	ARG_PETITIONER
They hail from respectable families.	ARG_PETITIONER
They are the earning members of their families.	ARG_PETITIONER
Their names are included in this case on account of past ill will.	ARG_PETITIONER
No grave nature of allegations are made against them.	ARG_PETITIONER
There is no evidence as to they were holding deadly weapons in their hands or they used such weapons in the incident in question.	ARG_PETITIONER
On perusal of the statement of witnesses, it creates doubt as to their presence at the time of incident in question.	ARG_PETITIONER
There is no evidence as to their direct involvement in the commission of the incident.	ARG_PETITIONER
The police have stated that the main offenders have been arrested and the weapons used to commit the offences have been recovered.	ARG_PETITIONER
Though the names of the Petitioners are found in the FIR and it is mentioned that they are accused-1, 3 and 4, but there is no evidence on record as to they have committed the alleged offences.	ARG_PETITIONER
 8 The Petitioners-1 and 2 are agriculturists.	ARG_PETITIONER
Inspite of it, they were arrested and produced before the Court.	ARG_PETITIONER
The Petitioner No.3 is arrested 20 days ago.	ARG_PETITIONER
They are not required for investigation.	ARG_PETITIONER
There are no grounds to continue them in the judicial custody.	ARG_PETITIONER
The alleged offences are not punishable with death or life imprisonment.	ARG_PETITIONER
They are the permanent residents of Kogilavadi village.	ARG_PETITIONER
They are ready and willing to abide by the terms and conditions that would be imposed by this Court.	ARG_PETITIONER

 13. It is contended by the Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1910/2014 that they are innocents of the alleged offences and they are law abiding citizens.	ARG_PETITIONER
There is no prima facie case against them.	ARG_PETITIONER

2nd Petitioner is a young boy.	ARG_PETITIONER
They are ready and willing to abide by the terms and conditions that would be imposed by this Court.	ARG_PETITIONER
So they prayed to grant them regular bail.	ARG_PETITIONER
 14. On the other hand, it is the case of the prosecution that, there is a prima facie case against the Petitioners of all the cases for having committed the alleged offences.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The statements of witnesses have been recorded.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The material objects have been seized.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The deadly weapons-Chopper, Gun etc., have been seized at the instance of accused persons.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Petitioner No.2 Harish of Crl.Mis.No.1910/2014 was arrested and subjected to investigation.	ARG_RESPONDENT
He revealed that he 9  Crl.Mis.Nos.1857,1817,1869 & 1910/14 made criminal conspiracy with other accused persons to murder the deceased Mahadeva.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Thereafter on seeing that the deceased was coming alone, he informed other accused over phone.	ARG_RESPONDENT

The alleged offence punishable under Section 302 of the I.P.C. is punishable with death or life imprisonment.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Investigation is not yet completed.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Statements of important witnesses have to be recorded.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The Petitioners/accused are financially well of and politically influential persons.	ARG_RESPONDENT
If they are released, they may tamper with the prosecution witnesses, cause threat to the life of the Complainant and witnesses, abscond and hamper the investigation and trial.	ARG_RESPONDENT
There is a dispute between the accused and the Complainant in respect of a property.	ARG_RESPONDENT
A case has been registered at Crime No.262/2012 for the offence punishable under Section 307 of the I.P.C. and other offences and another case has been registered in Crime No.131/2012 for the offences under Sections 506, 307 of the I.P.C. along with other offences.	ARG_RESPONDENT
They are pending for consideration before the Court.	ARG_RESPONDENT
So the learned Public Prosecutor prayed to dismiss all the bail petitions.	ARG_RESPONDENT
 15. The learned counsel for the Petitioners has relied upon the following decisions reported in (1) 2014 (3) KCCR 1900 (2) 2011 (4) KCCR 3091 (3) 2010(1) Crimes 13 (Kar.) 10 (4) Unreported decision passed by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in Criminal Petition No.4477/2011 dated 14-09- 2011.

 (5) Unreported decision passed by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in Criminal Petition No.7745/2013 dated 06-03- 2014.	ARG_PETITIONER
 (6) 2010(1) Crimes 554	ARG_PETITIONER
I have gone through the principles laid down in the said decisions while disposing of the present bail petitions.	ANALYSIS
16. I have gone through the records of the case.	ANALYSIS
On perusal of the written complaint of the Complainant, it goes to show that accused-1 to 9 including several Petitioners of these petitions have murdered K.S.Mahadevappa by firing a bullet at him and assaulted him with a chopper.	ANALYSIS
There was a past ill will between the deceased and accused persons with regard to a land.	ANALYSIS
Some of the accused persons of the present case had earlier attempted to murder the deceased K.S.Mahadevappa for two times.	ANALYSIS
Accordingly, a case was registered in Crime No.131/2012 for the offence punishable under Section 307 of the I.P.C. and other I.P.C. offences and another case was registered in Crime No.262/2012 for the offence punishable under Section 307 of the I.P.C. including other I.P.C. offences.	ANALYSIS
Subsequently, after investigation, in the said two crime cases, charge sheets have been filed and cases have been registered against the accused persons at S.C.No.184/2014 and at S.C.No.113/2014 and they are pending before the Fast Track Court at Hunsur for trial.	ANALYSIS
In the instant cases, the accused have made a third attempt to murder K.S.Mahadevappa and finally they have succeeded in murdering K.S.Mahadevappa by firing a bullet at him and assaulting him with a Chopper.	ANALYSIS
The written complaint of the 11  Crl.Mis.Nos.1857,1817,1869 & 1910/14 Complainant reveals that, one Santhosh, sister's son of the Complainant aged 12 years is an eye witness to the incident in question.	ANALYSIS
The written complaint of the Complainant also reveals that the Complainant, his wife Shilpa, Sannappa and one Parashuram have seen accused-1 to 9 named in the FIR and written complaint while they were running away from the place of incident after committing the alleged offences by holding Chopper and Gun in their hands.	ANALYSIS
The learned counsel for the Petitioners submits that, according to Remand Applications filed, it does not reveal that, Santosh is an eye witness to the incident and Complainant and others have seen the accused persons while they were running away from the place of incident along with deadly weapons.	ANALYSIS
I am of the opinion that the case is still under investigation.	ANALYSIS
At this stage, I have no reasons to disbelieve the averments of the written complaint filed by the Complainant.	ANALYSIS
The records reveals that accused No.14 who is the Petitioner of Crl.Mis.No.1817/2014 and accused No.13 who is the Petitioner No.2 of Crl.Mis.No.1910/2014 are the members of criminal conspiracy to commit the alleged offences.	ANALYSIS
In the instant case, the material objects have been seized by the Investigating Officer at the instance of accused persons.	ANALYSIS
The Chopper used to commit the offences at the time of commission of the offences has been recovered at the instance of accused No.14-Shivannegowda of Crl.Mis.No.1817/2014 from his house.	ANALYSIS
Considering the material on record, it clearly establishes that the accused with an intention to destroy the evidence in order to escape from the criminal liability in S.C.No.184/2014 and S.C.No.113/2014 pending on the file of Fast Track Court at Hunsur where the accused had attempted to murder deceased K.S.Mahadevappa earlier for two times have murdered said K.S.Mahadevappa in this case in their third attempt on account of 12 past ill will existed between them with regard to a land.	ANALYSIS
There are sufficient material on record for the involvement of the Petitioners/accused in committing the grave and serious offence punishable under Section 302 of the I.P.C. which is punishable with death or life imprisonment.	ANALYSIS
Under the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the Petitioners are not entitled to be granted regular bail as prayed for by them.	ANALYSIS
 The Petitioners-1 and 2 of Crl.Mis.No.1857/2014 have prayed to grant them anticipatory bail apprehending their arrest by the Respondent/police in the present crime.	ANALYSIS
Admittedly the anticipatory bail has to be granted to the Petitioners who apprehends their arrest in a crime pertaining to non- bailable offences.	ANALYSIS
In the instant case, admittedly, the names of the Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1857/2014 are not found place either in the complaint or in the FIR or in any of the material placed before the Court.	ANALYSIS
The learned Public Prosecutor submits that these Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1857/2014 are not at all involved in the commission of the alleged offences.	ARG_RESPONDENT
They are not required by the police.	ARG_RESPONDENT
They are not connected with the present crime.	ARG_RESPONDENT
When such being the facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the opinion that the apprehension of these Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1857/2014 in this crime that they may be arrested by the Respondent/police is not well founded.	RATIO
So, I am of the opinion that they are not entitled for anticipatory bail, as admittedly they are not connected with the present crime.	RATIO
So far as the case relating to other Petitioners are concerned, there are sufficient material on record for having committed grave and serious nature of offence for murdering one K.S.Mahadevappa.	RATIO
Considering the facts and circumstances of the case under which the Petitioners/accused have committed the murder of K.S.Mahadevappa, I feel, if the Petitioners/accused are released on 13  Crl.Mis.Nos.1857,1817,1869 & 1910/14 bail, they may commit similar type of offences, tamper with the prosecution witnesses, prevent the witnesses from deposing true facts, abscond and hamper the investigation and trial.	RATIO
So, this is not a fit case to grant bail to the Petitioners of Crl.Mis.No.1817/2014, Crl.Mis.No.1869/2014 and Crl.Mis.No.1910/2014.	RATIO
The principles laid down in the aforesaid decisions relied on by the learned counsel for the Petitioners will not help to grant them bail.	RATIO
Accordingly, I answer Point Nos.1 and 2 in the Negative.	RPC
 Point No.3:- 17.	RPC
In the result, I proceed to pass the following:	RPC
:: COMMON ORDER ::	RPC
