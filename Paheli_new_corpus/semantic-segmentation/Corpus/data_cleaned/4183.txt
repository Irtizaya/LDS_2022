                                JUDGMENT	PREAMBLE
Mr. E.I.Sanmathi Adv. for Appellants- Revenue 1.	NONE
The Appellants-Revenue have filed this appeal u/s.260A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, raising purportedly certain substantial questions of law arising from the order of the ITAT, Bangalore Bench `B', Bangalore, dated 25.01.2017 passed in IT(TP)A No.191/Bang/2015 (Dy.Commissioner of Income Tax vs. M/s.Tesco Hindustan Service Centre Pvt. Ltd.,) for A.Y.2010-11. 2.	FAC
The proposed substantial questions of law framed in the Memorandum of appeal by the Appellants-Revenue are quoted below for ready reference:- Vs. M/s. Tesco Hindustan Centre Pvt. Ltd 3/11 " 1. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is right in law in holding that certain comparable cannot be taken as comparables on the basis of facts of a different case for different assessee without making any specific FAR analysis vis-a-vis he assessee  company in contrast to the fact that Tata Elxsi Limited satisfy all the qualitative and quantitative filters applied by the TPO? 2.	ISSUE
Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is right in law in directing the TPO to apply RPT filter of 15% by superimposing the decisions of the Tribunal in other cases without going into specific facts of the taxpayer and without adducing the basis for arriving at the 15% cut off for RPT filters?	ISSUE
3. Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is right in law in rejecting few companies chosen by Transfer Pricing Officer as comparables on the basis of functional dissimilarity by following its earlier order which has not reached finality even when the same satisfied qualitative and quantitative tests in the case of the assessee?".

` 4. Regarding substantial question of law Nos.2 and 3  The learned Tribunal, after discussing the rival contentions of both the Appellants-Revenue and the Respondent-assessee, has given the following findings against Revenue with regard to various issues raised before it with regard to `Transfer Pricing' and `Transfer Pricing Adjustments' made by the concerned authorities below.	RLC
We consider it appropriate to quote the relevant portion of the order of Tribunal, which runs as hereunder:- "12.	RLC

5/11 Tribunal in assessee's own case for the Assessment Year 2006-07 vide order dt.18-10- 2016 in IT(TP)A No.1633/Bang/2012 has considered the comparability of these four companies and rejected these companies by considering the RPT at 15% as well as functional comparability.	RLC
We find that the DRP has given the details of RPT of all the 10 companies at page 11 and therefore the following three companies will be excluded as not satisfying the tolerance range of 15% RPT filter. (i) Fortune Infotech Ltd.  RPT 25% (ii) Icra Online Ltd.      RPT 19.61% (iii) Sundaram Business Services Ltd. RPT 29.44% 13.	RLC
As regards Accentia Technologies Ltd. and ICRA Online Ltd. this Tribunal in the assessee's own case for the Assessment Year 2008-09 has excluded these two companies from the set of comparables in para 5 as under: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx	RLC
We further note that the functional comparability has been examined in detailed by Vs. M/s.	RLC

Further in the case of Acropetal Technologies Ltd. (Seg.) the co-ordinate bench of this Tribunal in the case of Kodiak Networks (India) Pvt. Ltd. Vs. DCIT in IT(TP)A No.1540/Bang/2012 has considered the functional comparability and found that this company is not comparable with a captive service provider.	RLC
Accordingly we direct the Assessing Officer/TPO to exclude these companies from set of comparables.	RLC
 E-clerx Services Limited 14.1	ANALYSIS
We have considered the rival submissions and relevant record.	ANALYSIS
At the out set, we note that the comparability of M/s Eclerx Services Ltd. has been examined by the Special Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Maersk Global Centres (India) (P) Ltd (supra) in para 82 83 as under: 82. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 83.	ANALYSIS
For the reasons given above, we are of the view that if the functions actually performed Vs. M/s.	ANALYSIS

are compared with the functional profile of M/s eClerx Services Pvt. Ltd. and Mold-Tech Technologies Ltd., it is difficult to find out any relatively equal degree of comparability and the said entities cannot be taken as comparables for the purpose of determining ALP of the transactions of the assessee company with its AEs.	ANALYSIS
We, therefore, direct that these two entities be excluded from the list of 10 comparables finally taken by the AO/TPO as per the direction of the DRP?.	ANALYSIS
15.4 We have heard the rival submissions and perused and carefully considered the material on record.	ANALYSIS
We find that the assessee has brought on record sufficient evidence to establish that this company is functionally dis- similar and different from the assessee and hence is not comparable and the finding rendered in the case of Trilogy E-Business Software India Pvt. Ltd. (supra) for Assessment Year 2007-08 is applicable to this year also.	ANALYSIS
We are inclined to concur with the argument put forth by the assessee that Infosys BPO Ltd. is not functionally comparable since it has the benefit of market value as well as brand value.	ANALYSIS
This company Vs.	ANALYSIS
M/s. Tesco Hindustan Centre Pvt. Ltd 8/11 enjoys the benefits of scale and market leadership.	ANALYSIS
In this view of the matter, we hold that this company ought to be omitted from the set of comparable companies.	ANALYSIS
It is ordered accordingly.	ANALYSIS
Since we have directed the A.O/TPO to exclude these companies from the set of comparables therefore the TPO is directed to compute the ALP on the basis of remaining comparables". 5.	ANALYSIS
This Court in ITA No.536/2015 C/w ITA No.537/2015    delivered           on  25.06.2018 (Prl. Commissioner of Income Tax & Anr. Vs. M/s. Softbrands India Pvt. Ltd.,) has held that in these type of cases, unless an ex-facie perversity in the findings of the learned Income Tax Appellate Tribunal is established by the appellant, the appeal at the instance of an assessee or the Revenue under Section 260-A of the Act is not maintainable.	PRE_RELIED
 The relevant portion of the said judgment is quoted below for ready reference: " Conclusion: Vs. M/s. Tesco Hindustan Centre Pvt. Ltd 9/11 55.	PRE_RELIED
A substantial quantum of international trade and transactions depends upon the fair and quick judicial dispensation in such cases.	PRE_RELIED
Had it been a case of substantial question of interpretation of provisions of Double Taxation Avoidance Treaties (DTAA), interpretation of provisions of the Income Tax Act or Overriding Effect of the Treaties over the Domestic Legislations or the questions like Treaty Shopping, Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), Transfer of Shares in Tax Havens (like in the case of Vodafone etc.), if based on relevant facts, such substantial questions of law could be raised before the High Court under Section 260-A of the Act, the Courts could have embarked upon such exercise of framing and answering such substantial question of law.	PRE_RELIED
On the other hand, the appeals of the present tenor as to whether the comparables have been rightly picked up or not, Filters for arriving at the correct list of comparables have been rightly applied or not, do not in our considered opinion, give rise to any substantial question of law.	PRE_RELIED
 56. We are therefore of the considered opinion that the present appeals filed by the Revenue do not give rise to any substantial Vs. M/s. Tesco	RATIO
Hindustan	RATIO
Centre	RATIO
Pvt. Ltd	RATIO
10/11 question of law and the suggested substantial questions of law do not meet the requirements of Section 260-A of the Act and thus the appeals filed by the Revenue are found to be devoid of merit and the same are liable to be dismissed.	RATIO
 57. We make it clear that the same yardsticks and parameters will have to be applied, even if such appeals are filed by the Assessees, because, there may be cases where the Tribunal giving its own reasons and findings has found certain comparables to be good comparables to arrive at an `Arm's Length Price' in the case of the assessees with which the assessees may not be satisfied and have filed such appeals before this Court.	ANALYSIS
Therefore we clarify that mere dissatisfaction with the findings of facts arrived at by the learned Tribunal is not at all a sufficient reason to invoke Section 260-A of the Act before this Court.	RATIO
 58. The appeals filed by the Revenue are therefore dismissed with no order as to costs."	ANALYSIS
 6. Having heard the learned counsels for the parties, we are therefore of the opinion that no substantial question of law arises in the present case Vs. M/s. Tesco Hindustan Centre Pvt. Ltd 11/11 also.	RPC
The appeal filed by the Appellants-Revenue is liable to be dismissed and it is dismissed accordingly.	RPC
No costs.	RPC
 Copy of this judgment be sent to the Respondent- Assessee forthwith.	NONE
