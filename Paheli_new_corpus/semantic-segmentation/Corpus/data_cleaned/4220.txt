 5.  	ANALYSIS
In support of its case prosecution has examined eight witnesses.	ANALYSIS
P.W.1, P.W.2, P.W.3 and P.W.5 are independent occurrence witnesses, P.W.4 is the informant, P.W.6 is the I.O, P.W.7 and P.W.8 are independent seizure witnesses.	ANALYSIS
Defence examined none in support of its plea.	ANALYSIS
 6.  P.W.4 is the informant in this case who deposed in his evidence that on 20.08.2017 at about 10 A.M, he got information from one Advocate namely Pabitra Jena that some person had broken the door of Room No.03 of Old Bar Association, Uditnagar.	ANALYSIS
P.W.4 stated that on getting such information he visited the spot and found that the lock of the door was broken and one T.V and some chairs are stolen away.	ANALYSIS
P.W.4 further deposed that police seized the stolen items and gave it in zima to him by executing a zimanama.	ANALYSIS
P.W.4 admitted the F.I.R which is marked as Ext.1 and his signature on it marked as Ext.1/1.	ANALYSIS
P.W.4 also admitted the zimanama which is marked as Ext.2 and his signature on it marked as Ext.2/1.	ANALYSIS
I.O. recovered the stolen items and the same was handed over to the informant by executing a zimanama.	ANALYSIS
P.W.4 who is the informant of this case did not whisper a single word implicating the accused persons.	ANALYSIS
7. P.W.6 is the I.O of this case who deposed before this court that on 20.08.2017 during course of investigation he examined the complainant and other witnesses, visited the spot and prepared spot map.	ANALYSIS
P.W.6 admitted the spot map which is marked as Ext.3 and his signature on it marked as Ext.3/1.	ANALYSIS
P.W.6 deposed that on 21.08.2017, he received information that the suspect is moving at Shitalpada and he proceeded to spot and apprehended the accused Rahul Pradhan and on interrogation he confessed his guilt and stated that he had committed theft of one TV and chair etc.	ANALYSIS
P.W.6 deposed that he had recorded the statement U/sec.27 Indian Evidence Act of accused Rahul Pradhan which is marked as Ext.4 and his signature on it marked as Ext.4/1.	ANALYSIS
P.W.6 deposed that accused lead him to place of concealment and seized 5 nos. of plastic moulded chair and one TV set up box and one iron Sabala and prepared seizure list which is marked as Ext.5 and his signature on it marked as Ext.5/1.	ANALYSIS
P.W.6 deposed that on further interrogation accused confessed that he had given the stolen TV to one Ishwar Das of Shanti colony, Oram Pada and accordingly I.O proceeded to the house of Ishwar Das and seized the stolen Samsung TV and prepared seizure list which is marked as Ext.6 and his signature on it marked as Ext.6/1.	ANALYSIS
P.W.6 deposed that on 31.08.2017 he gave the seized Samsung TV, 5 nos. of plastic moulded chairs, one set up box to the complainant in zima by executing a zimanma which is marked as Ext.2 and his signature on it marked as Ext.2/2.	ANALYSIS
On perusal of the statement recorded by P.W.6 U/sec.27 Indian Evidence Act regarding leading to discovery of the stolen items, it is revealed that the same was made in presence of three independent witnesses namely Chalu Oram, Adison Surin and Munna Sharma.	ANALYSIS
The witnesses have been examined by the prosecution as P.W.7, P.W.8 and P.W.5 respectively.	ANALYSIS
But the evidence of P.W.5, P.W.7 and P.W.8 creates lots of doubt as it has absolutely no incoherence with the facts mentioned by P.W.6 in his evidence.	ANALYSIS
P.W.5 stated in his evidence that on 20.08.2017 at about 10.30 A.M he saw that the door of the Old Bar Association at Uditnagar was broken and found that the TV, setup box and chairs were missing.	ANALYSIS
P.W.7 and P.W.8 stated that they donot know anything about this case and nothing has been seized in their presence.	ANALYSIS
P.W.7 admitted his signatures which are marked as Ext.4/2, Ext.5/2 and P.W.6/2 respectively.	ANALYSIS
P.W.8 admitted his signatures which are marked as Ext.4/3, Ext.5/3 and Ext.6/3 respectively.	ANALYSIS
P.W.5, P.W.7 and P.W.8 have not whisper a single word with regard to leading to discovery given by the accused for recovery of the stolen items which is alleged to have been seized after being discovered being lead by the accused.	ANALYSIS
Hence I do not find the evidence of P.W.5, P.W.7 and P.W.8 in any way supporting the evidence of P.W.6.	ANALYSIS
There is enough contradiction in the evidence of P.W.5, P.W.7, P.W.8 and P.W.6.	ANALYSIS
It also creates reasonable doubt with regard to the statement marked as Ext.4 i.e. the statement of the accused recorded U/sec.27 Indian Evidence Act.	ANALYSIS
 Since the vital witnesses i.e P.W.5, P.W.7 and P.W.8 have not mentioned anything regarding leading to discovery , this court can not relay solely on the evidence of P.W.6 in this regard.	ANALYSIS
P.W.1stated in his evidence that on 19.08.2017 he closed the Room No.03 of Old Rourkela Bar Association office at about 5 P.M and locked the same.	ANALYSIS
On the next day i.e. on 20.08.2017 at about 10 A.M he went to Old Bar Association Office and found that the lock of the Room No.10 was broken.	ANALYSIS
He further deposed that he went inside the room and found that one Samsung TV and 5 nos. of plastic chairs were stolen away.	ANALYSIS
P.W.2 and P.W.3 stated in their evidence that 20.08.2017 at about 9.30 A.M on receipt of intimation from P.W.1 regarding broken of door lock of Old Bar Association, they went inside the Room No.03 and fond that TV and 5 nos. of chairs have been stolen away.	ANALYSIS
The evidence of P.W-1, P.W-2 and P.W-3 only proves the fact of the alleged theft but the involvement of the present accused persons is not established from the evidence adduced by them 	ANALYSIS
9.  In such state of evidence this court finds that there is insufficient material to hold the accused persons guilty of the alleged offences.	RATIO
In the result, the accused persons are held not guilty of the offences punishable U/s 457/380/411 of I.P.C and are acquitted therefrom as per section 248(1) Cr.P.C.	RPC
The accused persons be set at liberty forthwith.	RPC
Enter the case as mistake of fact.	RPC
