 7. Having regard to the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioners in both the petitions and the learned High Court Government Pleader, this Court has gone through the charge sheet records.	NONE
 8. It is well settled that matters to be considered in an application for bail are: "(i) Whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the offence; (ii) nature and gravity of the charge; (iii) severity of the punishment in the event of conviction; (iv) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing, if released on bail; (v) character, behaviour, means, position and standing of the accused; (vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated; (vii) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with; and (viii) danger, of course, of justice being thwarted by grant of bail.	ANALYSIS
While a vague allegation that the accused may tamper with the evidence or witnesses, may not be a ground to refuse bail, if the accused is of such character that his mere presence at large would intimidate the witnesses or if there is material to show that he will use his liberty to subvert justice or tamper with the evidence, then bail will be refused."	ANALYSIS
 9. In a decision reported in (2018) 3 SCC 22 in the case of Dataram Singh v. State of Uttara Pradesh and Another, the Hon'ble Apex Court held as under: "A fundamental postulate of criminal jurisprudence is the presumption of innocence, meaning thereby that a person is believed to be innocent until found guilty.	PRE_RELIED
       However, there are instances in our criminal law where a reverse onus has been placed on an accused with regard to some specific offences but that is another matter and does not detract from the fundamental postulate in respect of other offences.	ANALYSIS
Yet another important facet of our criminal jurisprudence is that the grant of bail is the general rule and putting a person in jail or in a prison or in a correction home (whichever expression one may wish to use) is an exception.	ANALYSIS
       Unfortunately, some of these basic principles appear to have been lost sight of with the result that more and more persons are being incarcerated and for longer periods.	ANALYSIS
This does not do any good to our criminal jurisprudence or to our society."	ANALYSIS
10. The overt act alleged against accused No.9 is that he caught hold of Ravikumar and accused No.s7 and 8 assaulted him with talwar and rod.	ANALYSIS
Thre is no allegation that accused No.9 has assaulted any of the deceased or injured witnesses.	ANALYSIS
The overt act alleged against accused No.12 is that he held Nagappa Sattur and accused No.10 assaulted Nagappa Sattur with sword to his fingers and accused No.11 has assaulted Nagappa Sattur with stick on body.	ANALYSIS
The wound certificate of Nagappa Sattur reveal that 4 fingers are amputated and the said injury is grievous and that he has sustained cut lacerated wound on upper part of right elbow and the said injury is simple in nature.	ANALYSIS
The overt act alleged against accused No.14 is that he assaulted Basavaraj Sattur with stick.	ANALYSIS
The wound certificate of Basavaraj Sattur reveal that he has sustained injury to hand and it is opined that it is grievous in nature.	ANALYSIS
The overt act alleged against accused No.16 is that he assaulted Iranna Sattur with stick and accused No.17 assaulted Iranna Sattur with Machu.	ANALYSIS
The wound certificate of Iranna Sattur reveal two injuries (i) cut lacerated wound over left upper arm and (ii) multiple contusions abrasion on left shoulder and they are opined to be simple in nature.	ANALYSIS
No overt act is alleged against accused No.13 but his mere presence has been stated.	ANALYSIS
Apart from the above said overt act by accused Nos.9 to 14, 16 and 17, no other overt acts have been alleged against them.	ANALYSIS
There is no allegation of petitioners/accused Nos.9 to 14, 16 and 17 assaulting either deceased Veerabhadrappa or deceased Ravikumar.	ANALYSIS
Therefore, the petitioners/accused Nos.9 to 14, 16 and 17 are entitled for grant of bail subject to certain terms and conditions.	ANALYSIS
The main objection of the prosecution is that in the event of granting bail, the petitioners are likely to cause threat to the complainant and other prosecution witnesses.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The said objection may be set right by imposing stringent conditions.	ANALYSIS
11. In the facts and circumstances of the case and submission of the counsel, this Court is of the view that there are valid grounds for granting bail to petitioners/accused Nos.9 to 14, 16 and 17 subject to certain terms and conditions.	RATIO
Hence, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER Criminal Petition No. 100935/2020 and Criminal Petition No.100951/2020 are allowed.	RPC
                The petitioners/accused Nos.9 to 14, 16 and 17 shall be released on bail in Crime No.112/2019 of Kalghatagi Police Station subject to the following conditions: i) The petitioners/accused Nos.9 to 14, 16 and 17 shall execute a personal bond for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh only) each with two sureties for the like sum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional Court.
