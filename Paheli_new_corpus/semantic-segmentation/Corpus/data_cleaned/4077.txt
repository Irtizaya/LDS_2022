THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS THIS DAY,THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:                                   O R D E R 	PREAMBLE
This criminal petition is filed under section 438 of Cr.P.C., for an order of anticipatory bail in Cr.No.20/2016 registered by the Kolar Excise Police for the offences punishable under sections 8, 20(b)(ii)(A) and section 42(1) 60(1), 63 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (for short "NDPS Act 1985").	FAC
The application moved by the petitioner before the Principal Sessions Judge, Kolar has been rejected by order dated 25.11.2016 in Crl.Misc.No.706/2016 for the reason that I.O. is required to interrogate the petitioner to ascertain the source of ganja.	FAC
2. In the F.I.R. it is stated that on 10.11.2016 at 12.45 p.m., the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Kolar Division along with Assistant Commissioner of Excise and his staff raided the petty shop belonging to accused No.2 and seized 500 gms. of ganja which was kept for selling purposes and arrested Rangappa accused No.1 and Venkatappa  accused No.2 at the spot.	FAC
The petitioner herein is shown as accused No.3.	FAC
There are no allegations whatsoever against the petitioner in the FIR.	FAC
 3. Learned HCGP would submit that the quantity of the psychotropic substance involved in this case is only 500 gms. which falls within the small quantity and therefore, the petition filed under section 438 of Cr.P.C., is not maintainable as the offences alleged against the petitioner are bailable offences.	FAC
4. In view of the above contention, the only point that arise for consideration is, whether the application for bail under section 438 of Cr.P.C. is maintainable in respect of the offences alleged against the petitioner?	ISSUE
 5. It is the case of the prosecution that 500 gms.of ganja was seized from the possession of accused Nos.1 and 2.	ANALYSIS
As per the table notified under clauses (viia) and (xxiiia) of section 2 of the NDPS Act, 1985, ganja upto 1000 gms., is specified as small quantity.	ANALYSIS
Case is registered against the petitioner under section 8, 20(B)(ii)(A), 42(1), 60(1) and 63 of the Act.	ANALYSIS
 6. Section 8 of the NDPS Act prohibits a person from possessing any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance except for medical or scientific purposes.	ANALYSIS
 7. Section 20 of the NDPS Act provides for punishment.	STA
It reads as under: "Section 20. Punishment for contravention in relation to cannabis plant and cannabis.-	STA
Whoever, in contravention of any provisions of this Act or any rule or order made or condition of licence granted thereunder,- (a) cultivates any cannabis plant; or (b) produces, manufactures, possesses, sells, purchases, transports, imports inter-State, exports inter-State or uses cannabis, shall be punishable (i) where such contravention relates to clause (a) with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to one lakh rupees; and (ii) where such contravention relates to sub-clause (b),- (A) and involves small quantity, with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both.	STA
 (B) and involves quantity lesser than commercial quantity but greater than small quantity, with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees; (C) and involves commercial quantity, with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to twenty years and shall also be liable to fine which shall not be less than one lakh rupees but which may extend to two lakh rupees: Provided that the court may, for reasons to be recorded in the judgment, impose a fine exceeding two lakh rupees." 8.	STA
In the instant case, as the contraband seized from the possession of accused Nos.1 and 2 is of small quantity, the offences alleged against the petitioner are punishable with rigorous imprisonment of one year or with fine, which may extend to ten thousand rupees, or with both.	ANALYSIS
 9. In this context, it may also be necessary to refer to section 36-A of the NDPS Act which deals with the offences triable by the Special Court.	ANALYSIS
Sub-section (a) thereof reads as under: "Section 36A.- Offences triable by Special Courts.-	STA
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974),- (a) all offences under this Act which are punishable with imprisonment for a term of more than three years shall be triable only by the Special court constituted for the area in which the offence has been committed or where there are more Special Courts than one for such area, by such one of them as may be specified in this behalf by the Government." 10.	STA
From the above provisions it is clear that all offences which are punishable with imprisonment for a term of more than three years are triable only by the Special Court whereas the other offences could be tried by the Special Court or by the judicial magistrate in accordance with the provisions of the Act.	ANALYSIS
 11. The Act is a self-contained code.	ANALYSIS
However, the application of the provisions of Cr.P.C. have not been excluded either expressly or by implication under the Act.	ANALYSIS
With regard to the grant of bail, section 37 of the Act imposes certain restrictions in respect of the offences committed under the Act.	ANALYSIS
The said section is extracted as here below: "Section 37. Offences to be cognizable and non-bailable.-	STA
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)- (a)        every offence punishable under this Act shall be cognizable; (b) no person accused of an offence punishable for offences under section 19 or section 24 or section 27A and also for offences involving commercial quantity shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless-- (i) the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release."	STA
 (ii) where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.	STA
 (2) The limitations on granting of bail specified in clause (b) of sub-section (1) are in addition to the limitations under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or any other law for the time being in force, on granting of bail." 12.	STA
A bare perusal of the above provision reveals that the restrictions imposed under section 37 pertain only to the grant of bail to the persons accused of the offences under sections 19, 24 or section 27A and also for offence involving commercial quantity.	ANALYSIS
To this extent, the provisions of section 37 override the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure.	ANALYSIS
In other matters, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure will apply to the offences under the NDPS Act.	ANALYSIS
Therefore, the argument of the learned Public Prosecutor that in view of the small quantity involved in the case, the application does not lie under section 438 of Cr.P.C. cannot be accepted.	ANALYSIS
But while considering the bail application under section 438 of Cr.P.C., it has to be noted that the investigation is still under progress.	RATIO
It cannot be foreseen at this juncture whether after thorough investigation any further quantity of the contraband would be unearthed by the authorized officers in the course of investigation.	RATIO
Therefore, solely on the basis of the weight of the contraband articles seized by the police, it would be hazardous and contrary to the intendment of the Act to admit the petitioner for anticipatory bail.	RATIO
In that view of the matter, the application deserves to be rejected and it is hereby rejected.	RPC
 Accordingly, the criminal petition is dismissed.	RPC
