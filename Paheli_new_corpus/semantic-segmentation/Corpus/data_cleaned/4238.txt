Status of the accused :On bail              Offence U/S. 47 (a)(ii) B & O Excise Act              J U D G M E N T	PREAMBLE
 1.      	FAC
The accused stands charged for allegedly committing offence u/s 47(a)(ii) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act (hereinafter referred to as B & O Excise Act) .	FAC
2.  The case of the prosecution as unfolded from the PR is that on 07.08.16 at about 07.30 AM, while the then SI of Excise, Sadar Charge, Sundargarh Smt S.Pradhan was performing patrolling duty along with her staff at Tileikani area, on suspicion she detained the accused.	FAC
After observing all legal formalities of search, she searched the accused and recovered one white colour plastic jarkin containing some liquid substance which on measurement was found to be 3 liters.	FAC
The SI of Excise tested the contents of the plastic jarkin by blue litmus paper and it turned into red.	FAC
She also conducted hydrometer test of the same.	FAC
From such tests, from the color and odor of the liquid and from her departmental experience and distillery training, she confirmed the same to be nothing but ID liquor.	FAC
Hence, she seized the same in presence of witnesses and prepared seizure list.	FAC
 On the basis of the P.R. submitted by the I.O., cognizance was taken and subsequently trial commenced against the accused for allegedly committing offence under section 47(a) of Bihar and Orissa Excise Act.	FAC
Hence, this case.	FAC
3. The plea of defence is one of denial and false implication .	FAC
4. Points for determination : (i) Whether on 07.08.16 at about 07.30 AM at Tileikani area the Excise officials seized 3 liters of ID liquor from exclusive and conscious possession of the accused ?(ii) Whether the seized articles was nothing but ID liquor ?	ISSUE
 5. In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined as many as three witnesses out of whom P.W.1 is the SI of Excise, P.W.2 is the Excise staff who had accompanied P.W.1 during the alleged patrolling duty and P.W.3 is an independent seizure witness.	FAC
On the other hand the defence has preferred not to examine any witness on behalf of the accused.	FAC
 6.  In order to establish seizure, P.W.1 has deposed that on 07.08.a6 at about 7.30 AM while conducting patrolling duty along with her staff at Tileiknai area on suspicion, she searched the accused and recovered one plastic jarkin containing some liquid substance which on measurement was found to be 3 liters.	FAC
As per her evidence she conducted blue litmus paper test and hydrometer test of the liquid and after being confirmed about the nature of the liquid to be ID liquor, she seized the same from the possession of the accused and prepared seizure list vide Ext.1.	FAC
P.W.2 has also deposed in the same light as that of P.W.1.	FAC
On the other hand P.W.3 the independent witness, has not supported the seizure in any manner.	FAC
 During course of cross-examination P.W.1 has admitted that the seized liquor has not been produced in court during course of trial.	FAC
P.W.1 has further admitted that the spot was a busy place many people had gathered on the spot and she was not able to say the name of the witnesses present at the spot.	FAC
She was also not able to say the names of the nearby house owners .It	FAC
appears from the evidence adduced that though the spot of seizure was a road but no independent corroboration is there to prove the fact of seizure.	FAC
In the absence of independent corroboration to the evidence of the Excise personnel, the prosecution case is suspicious.	FAC
The seized article was also not produced before the Court during the course of trial.	FAC
Prosecution has also not adduced any evidence that the accused had dominion or control over the seized article.	FAC
In view of the above discussion, the fact that the seized article was recovered from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused becomes doubtful.	ANALYSIS
Hence, it is concluded that prosecution has failed to prove the factum of seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused beyond all the reasonable doubts.	ANALYSIS
7.           	ANALYSIS
So far as the nature of liquor is concerned though P.W.1 has deposed that she tested the contents of the plastic jarkin with the help of blue litmus paper and such paper turned into red and also conducted Hydrometer test.	ANALYSIS
As per her evidence, from such tests, from the color and odor of the liquid and from her departmental experience and distillery training, she confirmed the same to be nothing but ID liquor.	ANALYSIS
Law is well settled that chemical test is the surest test of liquor.	ANALYSIS
Where chemical test has not been done and other tests like blue litmus paper and hydrometer test etc. has been done,the burden lies on the prosecution to establish that the officer is specially trained and has long departmental experience so that his evidence can be accepted as expert opinion and can substitute chemical test.	ANALYSIS
In absence of any chemical test so also any document to prove that the S.I can be regarded as expert, it is not safe to rely on the testimony of P.W.1.	ANALYSIS
In view of the above discussion, the allegation that the seized article is nothing but ID liquor comes under cloud.	RATIO
Hence, it can be safely concluded that prosecution has failed to prove that the seized article is ID liquor beyond all reasonable doubts.	RATIO
 8.           In the present case after analyzing the evidence on record, I find it fair enough to acquit the accused on the ground that prosecution has miserably failed to prove the occurrence itself.	RATIO
In the result I hold the accused not guilty of offence u/s 47(a) (ii) of Bihar and Orissa Excise Act and is acquitted therefrom as per the provision of section 248(1) of Cr.P.C.	RPC
The accused be set at liberty forthwith and be discharged from her bail bond so far as this case is concerned .	RPC
9. The seized articles be destroyed after four months of expiry of the appeal period in case of no appeal and in case of any appeal as per the order of the Appellate Court.	RPC
Enter this case as mistake of fact for statistical purpose .	RPC
