This appeal arises out of the judgment and order dated 22.1.2004, passed by Ad-hoc Additional Sessions Judge, Gadchiroli in Sessions Case No.22/2009 whereby the appellant was convicted for an offence under section 376(1) of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to suffer R.I. for seven years and to pay fine of RS.2,000/-, in default to suffer R.I. for six months.              2]	FAC
The prosecution case as unfolded in the first information report is thus: the accused was a teacher in a School at village Muska, tahsil Dhanora, district: Gadchiroli.	FAC
Victim and her parents reside in the same village.	FAC
They were acquainted with the accused.	FAC
At the relevant time the age of the victim was 16  years.	FAC
She had patches of leucoderma (white patches) on her forehead and hand.	FAC
The accused suggested to her parents that he was acquainted with some doctor at Nagpur who would be able to provide treatment to the girl.	FAC
Accused carried girl to Nagpur and for meeting the expenses of the treatment obtained Rs.2,000/- from her father.	FAC
On the way to Nagpur they stayed in a lodge at Gadchiroli.	FAC
It is alleged that in the night the accused had sexual intercourse with the girl.	FAC
Thereafter she was carried to Nagpur and the doctor was consulted.	FAC
After 15-20 days of this incident again the girl accompanied the accused for going to Nagpur.	FAC
Since they could not meet the doctor they were required to make halt in the lodge in the night.	FAC
Again the accused had sexual intercourse with the girl.	FAC
She conceived form him.	FAC
              Ultimately, on 28.8.1997 the first information report came to be lodged and on that basis the offence under section 376 of Indian Penal Code came to be registered.	FAC
3] Victim was examined by the Medical Officer.	FAC
She was found carrying fetus of 22 weeks.	FAC
Her radiological examination revealed that she was in between 16-18 years of age.	FAC
After investigation the charge sheet was submitted.	FAC
The Additional Sessions Judge framed and explained the charge to the accused.	FAC
He pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.	FAC
The prosecution examined 7 witnesses.	FAC
After considering the evidence, learned Additional Sessions Judge held that sexual intercourse committed by the accused with victim was against her will.	RLC
He therefore, proceeded to convict and sentence him as stated above.	FAC
4] The learned counsel for the appellant assails the judgment impugned mainly on the ground that it is based upon conjunctures and surmises.	ARG_PETITIONER
The inference drawn by the learned Additional Sessions Judge that the sexual intercourse was without consent of the victim is inconsistent with the material placed on record.	ARG_PETITIONER
According to him, the victim being above 16 years of age her consent was material.	ARG_PETITIONER
Her conduct in accompanying the accused, staying with him in the lodge not once, but twice and not lodging any protest till she noticed that she was pregnant, only point out that she had consented for the sexual intercourse.	ARG_PETITIONER
 According to the learned counsel this material aspect involved in the case has been ignored by the learned Additional Sessions Judge and thus committed an error in convicting the accused.	ARG_PETITIONER
Learned A.P.P. supported the judgment and order of conviction and sentence.	ARG_RESPONDENT
According to him accused taking advantage of the position, carried the girl with him for providing her treatment.	ARG_RESPONDENT
He took undue advantage of her helplessness and committed sexual intercourse with her.	ARG_RESPONDENT
On the second occasion also against the will of the victim he had sexual intercourse with her.	ARG_RESPONDENT
When she conceived, he disowned paternity and fled away from the village.	ARG_RESPONDENT
He therefore, contended that the learned Additional Sessions Judge was right in convicting the accused for the offence punishable under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code.	ARG_RESPONDENT
6] The victim narrated the first incident of the accused committing sexual intercourse with her as under: "The accused came on my cot.	FAC
Due to this I woke up.	FAC
Accused caught me.	FAC
Accused stated me as nobody is here, and stated me to allow him for committing sexual intercourse.	FAC
I refused for the sexual act.	FAC
I stated him as to why he is not feeling shame for asking me about the evil act.	FAC
Accused committed sexual intercourse with me.	FAC
The accused committed sexual intercourse with me.	FAC
The accused committed sexual intercourse with me forcibly.	FAC
Accused committed sexual intercourse with me forcibly.	FAC
Accused stated me that he will see if any wrong happened with me.	FAC
The accused committed sexual intercourse with me forcibly.	FAC
Accused stated me that he will see if any wrong happened with me.	FAC
I was weeping when accused was committing sexual intercourse with me.	FAC
Due to threatening of accused, I had not stated anybody about this incident."	FAC
About the second incident, she narrated as under: "After one month, again accused came to my house for taking me at Nagpur.	FAC
Alongwith accused I had gone to Nagpur.	FAC
I was not intending to go with him.	FAC
On the say of my parents, I had gone with him at Nagpur.	FAC
At about 2.30 p.m. along with accused I reached at Nagpur.	FAC
We had gone to the hospital, but the doctor was not present in the hospital.	FAC
Accused taken me in a lodge at Nagpur.	FAC
Accused made his signature in the register of lodge.	FAC
There were two cots in the room of lodge.	FAC
At about 9 p.m. I was lying on my cot.	FAC
On the next morning, we had gone to hospital and thereafter came back to our village.	FAC
The accused had not committed sexual intercourse with me at that night."	FAC
              7]	FAC
It is only when the learned A.P.P. was allowed to put leading question to this witness she had stated that on the second occasion also the accused had committed sexual intercourse with her.	FAC
The relevant part of her testimony is reproduced below: "I stated about adopting pregnancy to accused.	FAC
he stated that he will cause terminate the same.	FAC
Thereafter the accused was absconded.	FAC
There was meeting in the village about adopting (conceiving) pregnancy by me.	FAC
At that time I stated the name of accused as he caused pregnancy to me.	FAC
Prior to lodging the report, accused brought me at Armori.	FAC
He had taken me for terminating my pregnancy.	FAC
As the accused had not came to meeting and absconded after causing pregnancy to me, therefore, I have gone to police station."              8	FAC

What emerged from the above is that the victim who was aged more than 16 years voluntarily accompanied accused without any protest.	ANALYSIS
She agreed to spend night with him in room, not once, but twice.	ANALYSIS
              When they returned back, she kept mum.	ANALYSIS
After one month she again agreed to accompany him without any protest.	ANALYSIS
During her examination in chief she categorically stated that on the second occasion the accused did not have sexual intercourse with her.	ANALYSIS
For that reason leading questions were put to her.	ANALYSIS
After returning the house she kept mum.	ANALYSIS
Only because she conceived and accused did not help her in getting the pregnancy terminated, she lodged report.	ANALYSIS
In that view of the matter, the findings recorded by the learned Additional Sessions Judge in paragraph 24 of the judgment that there was no valid consent on the part of the victim, are misconceived and inconsistent with the evidence placed on record.	ANALYSIS
10] P.W.2 the father of the victim admitted in cross- examination that: "My daughter stated about the pregnancy and, therefore, there was meeting of panchas.	FAC
I had not gone to the meeting."	FAC
11] In case of Jintudas ..vs.. State of Asam reported in 2003 Cri.L.J. 1411 the Learned Single Judge of the Gauhati High Court while dealing with the case involving similar facts and after considering evidence relating to the conduct of the victim observed that: "If a full grown woman consents to act of sexual intercourse on a promise of marriage and continues to indulge in such activity until she becomes pregnant, it is an act of promiscuity on her part and not an act induced by misconception of fact.	PRE_RELIED
In such facts and circumstances, the irresistible conclusion is that the accused had sexual intercourse with her consent.	PRE_RELIED
More so, when this act has been corroborated by circumstances that she did not tell anybody about the sexual intercourse with the accused appellant till she became pregnant.	PRE_RELIED
                      In such a case conviction of accused for offence of rape is not proper." 12] In case of Vettikuzhiyil Jaison alias Jose ..vs..              	PRE_RELIED
The State, reported in 2003 Cri.L.J. 2482 the learned Single Judge of the Kerla High Court held that : "Evidence on record shows that prosecutrix was above 16 years of age on date of commission of alleged offence -	PRE_RELIED
According to prosecutrix accused had sexual intercourse with her on three occasions - Prosecutrix, however, not divulging incident to anybody till she was found pregnant by doctor - Prosecutrix not even offered resistance when accused attempted to have sexual intercourse with her in her own house  Nor raised alarm to draw attention of neighbours or escaped from house  	PRE_RELIED
No marks of injury found on private parts	PRE_RELIED
Held, entire conduct of prosecutrix shows that she was a consenting party."	PRE_RELIED
 13] In case of Uday ..vs..State of Karnataka reported in (2003)4 SCC 46, their lordship explained the term 'consent' occurring under section 90 and held that "burden is on the prosecution to prove each and every ingredient of the offence, absence of consent being one of them".              14]	PRE_RELIED
In order to prove that victim conceived from the accused the prosecution adduced no evidence.	RATIO
Even the elimination test based on the blood groups was not carried out much less D.N.A. test.	RATIO
Considering the evidence brought on record it is difficult to subscribe to the findings of the learned Additional Sessions Judge that there was no valid consent for the sexual intercourse.	RATIO
In that view of the matter the appeal succeeds.	RATIO
              15]	RPC
The appeal is allowed.	RPC
The judgment and order of conviction of the accused for the offence punishable under section 376 of I.P.C. is set aside.	RPC
