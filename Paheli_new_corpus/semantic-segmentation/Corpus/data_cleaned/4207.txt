After hearing the accused on the point of sentence, Learned Sessions Judge has passed further judgment awarding death sentence as against accused Nos.1 to 9, for the offence punishable under Section 302 r/w Section 149 of IPC, on four counts.	FAC
As required under sub-section (1) of Section 366 of Cr.PC, learned trial Judge has submitted the records for confirmation of Death sentence.	FAC
 6. Brief facts of the case leading to the filing of other three Appeals by the accused Nos.1 to 15 under Section 374(2) of Cr.P C may be stated as under:	FAC
The complainant-Suresh Siddappa Wodeyar (PW-1) and his family members are permanent residents of Murkibhavi village in Bailhongal Taluk.	FAC
The complainant's father has 7 brothers and all of them were residing together in the same place.	FAC
Ulavappa (husband of P.W-3) is the elder brother of the complainant.	FAC
It is stated that one and half years prior to 30.8.2005 ( i.e., the date of incident), when Kasturi-P.W3, had gone to Kumbarbhavi to fetch water, accused No.3/Sidlingappa and accused No.1/Sundresh picked up quarrel with her and poured water on her; she informed about the incident to her family members; they questioned the accused No.1/Sundresh and accused No.7/Chandranaik and their family members.	FAC
For which, the accused quarreled with the complainant and his family members.	FAC
It is also alleged that accused No.1/Sundresh and accused No.3/Sidlingappa were often teasing P.W.3 and blocking her way whenever she went to lands.	FAC
It is alleged that accused No.10/Mallawwa (wife of accused No.7/Chandranaik) used to taunt and challenge the complainant's family members and threatened with dire consequences if they lodged a complaint with Police.	FAC
 Further case of the prosecution is that on 29.8.2005 (Monday), at about 8.00 a m, when the complainant was washing his bullocks, Accused No.10/Mallawwa and Accused No.2/Siddappa, who were standing on the upstairs of their house, picked up quarrel with the complainant-P.W.1 and threw chappal at him.	FAC
He informed about the incident to his family members, for which they told him that a complaint would be lodged on the next day.	FAC
On 30.8.2005 (Tuesday) at about 6.30 AM, when the complainant-P.W1 was going to answer nature's call, Accused No.10/Mallawwa instigated the Accused to kill the complainant-P.W.1.	FAC
Accordingly, Accused No.1/Sundresh,  Accused  No.2/Siddappa,	FAC
 Accused No.3/Sidlingappa, Accused No.4/Kalmesh, Accused No.5/Rajshekhar, Accused No.6/Bhagwant and one Shivappa Chanbasappa Udkeri, Rudrappa Shankrappa Udkeri, Sidlingappa Apanna Konnennawar, Accused No.15/Doddanaik, Accused No.14/Sakranaik, Raju Sidlingappa Konnennawar, Accused No.12/Basavanneppa and Accused No.7/Chandranaik chased the complainant-P.W.1, who raised hue and cry and went inside his house; at that time, the complainant's grand father/Siddlingappa (the deceased) and his deceased uncles Mallappa and Nagappa, who are residents of the same lane, came and complainant's wife-Ratnawwa also came out of the house holding a plastic mug to go for nature's call; she requested the Accused not to do anything to her husband(PW- 1).	FAC
But on the other hand Accused No.2 assaulted Ratnawwa with kyota on left side of her chest and left arm.	FAC
Seeing the incident, grand father and uncles of the complaint were proceeding towards Police Station to lodge a complaint, but the Accused accosted them and assaulted and also threatened the public with dire consequences, if they intervened in their action.	FAC
Thus, the Accused assaulted Siddlingappa, Mallappa and Nagappa (grand father and uncles of the complainant) with koyta, axe, sickle, jambia, stick and stone.	FAC
PW-1 lodged a complaint with Nesargi Police Station.	FAC
The Police registered a case in Crime No.72/2005 on 30.8.2005 at about 8.15 A.M., for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 302, 109 and 506 r/w section 149 of IPC.	FAC
During the course of investigation, panchanamas were conducted.	FAC
Accused were arrested and recorded their voluntary statement and seized the incriminating articles.	FAC
After the investigation was over, charge sheet came to be laid against the Accused for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 307, 302, 114, 506 and 504 r/w Section 149 of IPC.	FAC
Since the offence under Sections 307 and 302 of IPC are exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions, the case was committed to Sessions Court, where it was registered as SC No.28/2006.	FAC
The trial Court, after hearing arguments, framed charges against all the 15 persons for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 302, 307, 114, 506, 504 read with Section 149 of IPC.	FAC

Statement of the Accused under Section 313 of Cr.PC was recorded.	FAC
Accused have denied all the incriminating circumstances appearing in the evidence of prosecution witnesses.	FAC
They have not adduced any defence evidence.	FAC
The trial Court, after hearing arguments, perusing oral and documentary evidence on record, came to a conclusion that the prosecution brought home the guilt to the Accused for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 302, 307, 114, 506, 504 read with section 149 of IPC.	RLC
After hearing the accused, on the point of sentence, held that the case falls within the scope of `rarest of the rare case' and awarded death sentence to Accused Nos.1 to 9 for the offence under Section 302 of IPC, on four counts.	RLC

RLC
 The trial court has ordered that the substantive sentences shall run one after another.	RLC
This is impugned in these Appeals.	FAC
 7. Sri V M Banakar, learned Addl. SPP appearing for the state, submitted that since four persons were brutally murdered with deadly weapons, the trial Court has rightly classified the case as "rarest of rare cases" and awarded death sentence as against Accused Nos.1 to 9 and the same may be confirmed.	ARG_RESPONDENT
He also submitted that the trial Court, on proper appreciation of oral and documentary evidence placed on record, rightly reached the conclusion that the prosecution has proved the guilt to the accused for the charges levelled against them and awarded adequate sentence for the offences and there is no merit in the Appeals filed by the Accused and the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence.	ARG_RESPONDENT
He has cited a decision reported in (2010) 1 SCC (CRI) 925 (DILIP PREMNARAYAN TIWARI AND ANOTHER Vs. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA) on the point of appreciation of evidence in so for as the discrepancies/omissions in FIR.	ARG_RESPONDENT
 8. Sri R B Naik, learned Senior Counsel appearing for Sri Basavaraj, for Accused Nos.1, 4 to 6,8,9,11,12 and 13, submitted that the trial Court erred in convicting the Accused solely on the basis of interested testimony of the witnesses, though all independent eye witnesses have turned hostile to prosecution.	ARG_PETITIONER
He further submits that though, the alleged eye witnesses, have not witnessed the incident, the trial Court erred in accepting their evidence as gospel truth to base conviction for the offences alleged against the accused.	ARG_PETITIONER
He further submitted that the case on hand cannot be treated as a `rarest of rare cases' to award death sentence.	ARG_PETITIONER
He prayed that the impugned judgment of conviction and sentence awarded against the Accused may be set aside and the all the accused may acquitted of the offences alleged them.	ARG_PETITIONER
He has cited the following decisions: (i)  AIR 1958 SC 935 (PURANMAL AGARWALLA Vs. STATE OF ORISSA) on the point that the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for any one of such offences; (ii)   (1988) 4 SCC 183 (MOHD. AKHTAR HUSSAIN ALIAS IBRAHIM AHMED BHATTI Vs. ASSISTANT            COLLECTOR  OF CUSTOMS(PREVENTION), AHMEDABAD AND ANOTHER) on the point that the Courts must take into consideration the usual factors while imposing sentences; and (iii)  (2010) 1 SCC 573 (RAMRAJ ALIAS NANHOO ALIAS BIHNU Vs. STATE OF CHHATTISGARH) on the point that imprisonment for life sentence was substituted for death sentence.	ARG_PETITIONER

11. For the purpose of convenience and better understanding, we proceed to take up points (i) to (iv) together for consideration. 12.	ANALYSIS

Accused Nos.9,12 and 13 are brothers.	ANALYSIS
All the independent eye witnesses, viz., P.Ws.6 to 15, P.Ws.20 to 24 have not supported the case of prosecution for the reasons best known to them.	ANALYSIS
Merely because those witnesses have not deposed in support of the prosecution, case of the prosecution cannot be rejected in toto.	ANALYSIS
Therefore,the evidence of P.Ws.1, 2,3,4,5 and 32, who are the eye witnesses cum related to the complainant require to be scrutinized carefully.	ANALYSIS
In our view, there is no strong ground to reject their evidence in toto for the following reasons.	ANALYSIS
 17. P.W1-Suresh, aged about 28 years, is the husband of the deceased-Ratnavva and grand son of the deceased Siddalingappa and nephew of the deceased Nagappa and Mallappa.	ANALYSIS
He has deposed in evidence that the deceased Siddalingappa had 8 sons and 2 daughters.	ANALYSIS
P.W-1 has deposed that his father-Siddappa died about 14 years back prior to the incident and his senior uncle-Basappa and his father though living in the same house of Siddalingappa, they had separate mess; whereas other 6 sons including the deceased Mallappa and Nagappa were living together with Siddalingappa and they had a common mess.	ANALYSIS
P.W2/Bhagawwa N Wadeyar is the sister of P.W1.	ANALYSIS
Ulavappa Siddappa Wadeyar is the elder brother of P.W1.	ANALYSIS
According to P.W-1, about 1 year prior to the incident, when P.W3/Kasturi (w/o P.W1's elder brother-Ulavappa Siddappa Wadeyar) had been to fetch water, Accused Nos.1 and 3 poured water and pulled her.	ANALYSIS
She informed about the incident to her family members including deceased persons; they enquired with the Accused.	ANALYSIS
Since then, Accused No.10/Mallawwa used to abuse the family members of the complainant, in vulgar language, whenever they went in front of her house; when P.W3/Kasturi was proceeding towards the land; Accused Nos.1 and 3 teased and abused her in vulgar language and also restrained her from proceeding further. She informed the incident to the family members.	ANALYSIS
When they questioned the Accused, there was exchange of words.	ANALYSIS
Again on 29.8.2005, at about 8.00 am, when the complainant was washing bullocks in front of his house, Accused No.10/Mallawwa, who was standing on the staircase of her house, teased him and threw slipper at him.	ANALYSIS
Accused No.10 and Accused No.2 threatened him with dire consequences.	ANALYSIS
Again, on 30.8.2005, at about 7.00 a m, when the complainant was going to attend nature's call, Accused Nos.1 to 9 were armed with long and axes etc., came along with other accused namely Accused Nos.10,11,12,13,14 and 15 and challenged the complainant and his family members and attempted to kill the complainant and his family members.	ANALYSIS
It is the case of the prosecution that on 30.8.2005 at about 6.30 a.m., all the Accused started chasing the complainant; he made hue and cry and went in side his house.	ANALYSIS
On hearing the hue and cry of Pw-1, his wife Ratnavva came to the entrance of their house and requested the Accused not to assault her husband-P.W.1, but Accused Nos.1, 2 and 9 assaulted her and killed at the entrance of her house.	ANALYSIS
P.W1 has deposed that he was hearing and also watching the scene from inside the house.	ANALYSIS
Thereafter, his grand father/Siddalingappa and uncles- Mallappa and Nagappa were proceeding towards Police Station to lodge a complain against the Accused and at that time Accused Nos.1 and 5 assaulted his uncle-Mallappa with axe and Accused Nos.3 and 7 with Koitha; Accused Nos.3 and 4 assaulted his grand father/Siddalingappa with koitha; whereas Accused Nos.8 and 9 assaulted Siddalingappa with an axe and Accused No.10 assaulted Siddalingappa with stone; his uncle- Nagappa was assaulted by Accused Nos.1 and 6 with an axe and Accused No.2 with long and within half an hour, the Accused killed four persons viz., his wife, uncles and grand father.	ANALYSIS
It is in his evidence that after assaulting his wife Ratnavva, grandfather-Siddlingappa, uncles Nagappa and Mallappa, all the accused chased him and PW-5 Maruthi with an intention to kill them.	ANALYSIS
PW.5-Maruthi escaped through Mallari Oni whereas he (PW-1) ran away from the village; 15 minutes later came to the spot and saw dead body of his wife, grandfather and uncles	ANALYSIS

 18. Now, we refer to the evidence of the Investigating Officer-Smt.Sonia Narang-PW.47 who was the Assistant Superintendent of Police at Bailhongal.	ANALYSIS
It is in her evidence that on 2.9.2005, she took up further investigation and the Circle Inspector of Police at Bailhongal produced accused Nos.1 and 4 before her with a report and she arrested them and they gave voluntary statement as per Ext.P.62 and 63, respectively and produced a Scooter bearing No.KA 24/E 1908, which was used by the accused for escaping from the scene of crime.	ANALYSIS
She seized the said Scooter under a panchanama in the presence of P.Ws.16 and 17 as per Ex.P12.	ANALYSIS
Further, she has seized axe (M.O-12), blue colour shirt (M.O- 47) and while lungi (M.O-48) at instance of Accused No.1 under a panchanama in the presence of the above-said panchas.	ANALYSIS
Likewise she has seized one long (M.O-19), shirt (M.O-50) and black and yellow checks lungi (M.O-51) at the instance of Accused NO4, under a panchayama (Ex.P-13).	ANALYSIS
She has further deposed that the CPI, Bailhongal, produced three accused persons viz., accused No.7/Chandranaik, accused No.3/Siddalingappa @ Mudakappa and accused No.5/Rajashekhar @ Gangappa before her on 10.9.2005 along with a report as per Ex.P-61.	ANALYSIS
She has recorded voluntary statement of Accused NO.5 and accused No.7 as per Ex.P65; Ex.P66 respectively and recovered their clothes worn at the time of incident and weapons used in the commission of crime.	ANALYSIS
She has deposed that on 16.9.2005, the ASI produced accused No.13/Nagappa Udakeri before her and she interrogated and produced him before the court for remand.	ANALYSIS
She received post mortem report.	ANALYSIS
She has sent 47 sealed articles to FSL, Belgaum for chemical examination and filed charge sheet on 8.3.2006.	ANALYSIS
The FSL report has been marked as Ex.P57.	ANALYSIS
IN the cross-examination of P.W-47, she has deposed that since the complainant himself gave further statement stating that the other accused mentioned in the FIR did not commit any offence, they were given up.	ANALYSIS
Nothing worthwhile is elicited in her cross-examination with regard to the evidence given before the trial Court.	ANALYSIS
Ex.P-47/FSL report reveals that 47 articles were subjected to chemical analysis and all the articles except two articles viz., sample mud and lungi were stained with blood.	ANALYSIS
Serology report has not been produced.	ANALYSIS
Ex.P.51-rough sketch of scene of crime, shows the place of crime and the place where the dead bodies were lying.	ANALYSIS
All the star witnesses were cross-examined by the defence at length by learned counsel for the accused, but nothing worth while was elicited to disbelieve their oral evidence as to the role of the accused in the commission of crime.	ANALYSIS
There is no major omissions and contradictions elicited in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses.	ANALYSIS
 19. It is the case of prosecution that the Accused persons are powerful members of the community in the village and the independent witnesses have not supported the case of prosecution fearing the accused.	ANALYSIS
It is alleged that Accused No.10 threw chappal at the complainant and instigated the Accused persons to kill the complainant and his family members and also assaulted on the fore head of the deceased Siddalingappa with a stone.	ANALYSIS
It is a fact that wife of P.W.1 was killed by the said accused in front of her house and when Siddalingappa along with his two sons-Mallappa and Nagappa were proceeding through Asundi Oni to Police Station, to lodge a complaint, the Accused persons chased them and killed and the dead bodies were lying in the same lane one after another.	ANALYSIS
The dead bodies lying on the street can be seen in the photographs at Exs.P26 to 29, taken at the scene of crime.	ANALYSIS
Though there is no mention in the complaint about the overt acts by Accused No.8, the evidence of the eye witnesses is sufficient to hold that all nine accused ( namely Nos.1 to 9), in pursuance of the common object and at the instigation of Accused No.10/Mallawwa, they have killed Ratnavva, Siddalingappa, Nagappa and Mallappa, within half an hour.	ANALYSIS
No doubt the name of Accused No.9/Shankreppa does not find a place in the FIR, but during the course of recording statement of the witnesses, he was arrested and according to the evidence of eye witnesses, Accused No.9 assaulted Ratnavva and Nagappa with an axe.	ANALYSIS
The contention of the learned counsel for the accused that Accused No.9 was falsely implicated in the case falls to the ground.	ANALYSIS
The prosecution has proved that all the above said four persons died an homicidal death.	ANALYSIS
Evidence on record is sufficient to hold that Accused Nos.1 to 10, with a common object, Rantnavva, Siddalingappa, Mallappa and Nagappa were killed and also attempted to kill PW.1-Suresh and PW.5-Maruthi and hence the order of conviction recorded by the trial court for the offence punishable under section 302 (on four counts) and 307 (on two counts) read with section 149 of IPC, does not call for our interference.	ANALYSIS
The evidence of the prosecution that accused No.11 to 15 abetted the crime is not sufficient to base conviction in the absence of cogent and satisfactory evidence and they are entitled for an order of an acquittal for all the offences alleged against them. 20.	ANALYSIS
The trial Court has classified the case of murder as 'rarest of rare cases' and awarded death sentence to Accused Nos.1 to 9.	ANALYSIS
Brutality is involved in every murder case.	ANALYSIS
Number of murders cannot be a ground to award death sentence.	ANALYSIS
The facts to be considered for awarding death sentence are the magnitude and the manner and brutality.	ANALYSIS
In the decision reported in 2003(7) SCC 141, supra, the Apex Court has held that "It is true that the incident in question has prematurely terminated the life of twenty-one people and the number of deaths cannot be the sole criterion for awarding the maximum punishment of death."	PRE_RELIED
In the decision reported in (2011)10 SCC 389, supra, Apex Court has held that the appellant/Accused would not be a menace to society and no reason to believe that the appellant cannot be reformed or rehabilitated or would constitute a continued threat to society and it is not the `rarest of the rare case' causing for extreme penalty of death.	PRE_RELIED
In the decision reported in (2011)13 SCC 706, supra, the Apex Court has held that murder committed in a very brutal and inhuman fashion alone cannot justify death sentence and in the absence of any evidence to show that the appellant was a continuing threat to society or was beyond reform and rehabilitation, death sentence cannot be sustained.	PRE_RELIED
In the case of Bachan Singh Vs. State of Punjab reported in (1980)2 SCC 684, the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court has held that "for a person convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception, and mitigating circumstances must be given due consideration and death sentence can be awarded only in the `rarest of rare cases' and for special reasons to be recorded."	PRE_RELIED
In the decision reported in 2012(4) SCC 289, supra, the Apex Court has held that by drawing balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and examining them in the light of facts and circumstances of the case, concluded that this was not a case where extreme penalty of death be imposed upon the accused and therefore, death sentence awarded to the accused was commuted to one of life imprisonment of 21 years.	PRE_RELIED
In the above-said case i.e., Brijendrasingh's case, the Apex Court has given the cases falling under the category of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.	PRE_RELIED
The Apex Court has laid down the principles to determine whether this case falls within the scope of rarest of rare cases for imposition of death sentence.	PRE_RELIED
The principles laid down by the Apex Court are as under: " (i) The Court has to apply the test to determine, if it was the 'rarest of rare' case for imposition of a death sentence; (i) In the opinion of the court, imposition of any other punishment i.e., life imprisonment would be completely inadequate and would not meet the ends of justice; (ii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception; (iii) The option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be cautiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all relevant circumstances; and (iv) The method (planned or otherwise) and the manner (extent of brutality and inhumanity, etc.) in which the crime was committed and the circumstances leading to commission of such heinous crime."	ANALYSIS
 21. Accused Nos.1 to 6 and 8 are aged between 18 and 38 years; whereas Accused Nos.7 and 9 are aged about 51 and 53 years.	RATIO
Keeping in view the above principles laid down by the Apex Court, we are of the considered view that death sentence awarded by the trial court is contrary to the principles laid down by the Apex Court.	RATIO
 22. Accordingly we answer the points for consideration partly in favour of the accused.	ANALYSIS
