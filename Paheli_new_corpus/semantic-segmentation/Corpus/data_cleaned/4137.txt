         This petition coming on for Orders this day, the Courtmade the following :                                       ORDER 	PREAMBLE
Petitioner has preferred this petition under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. praying to enlarge him on bail in connection with Crime No.27/2003 registered by the respondent - Police for offences punishable under Sections 14, 32 read with Section 34 of Karnataka Excise Act and pending C.C. No.1854/2016 before JMFC III Court, Mangaluru.	FAC
2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned HCGP for the respondent.	FAC
Perused the first information report, charge sheet and other papers produced along with the petition.	FAC
 3. Learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that two cases have been registered against the petitioner in crime Nos.27/2003 for the offences punishable under Sections 14, 32 read with Section 34 of Karnataka Excise Act and in crime No.137/2003 for the offences punishable under Sections 11, 14, 32, 34 and 38A of Karnataka Excise Act.	ARG_PETITIONER
He had obtained bail in both cases from the jurisdictional Magistrate.	ARG_PETITIONER
Due to personal inconvenience, the petitioner had not attended the cases.	ARG_PETITIONER
Consequently, the trial Court cancelled the bail.	RLC
The petitioner, being aggrieved by the cancellation of bail by the trial Court, applied for a fresh bail before the Sessions Court in Criminal Misc. Case No.743/2016 in respect of crime No.137/2003 and Criminal Misc.Case No.779/2016 in respect of Crime No.27/2003.	FAC
The learned Counsel submits that Criminal Misc. Case No.743/2016 came up for consideration before the II Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangaluru and the said Court was pleased to allow the petition and granted bail considering the fact that the petitioner's father was seriously ill, whereas Criminal Misc. Case No.779/2016 came up for consideration before the III Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangaluru and the learned Judge rejected the bail application on the ground that the petitioner is in the habit of violating the conditions of the bail and no grounds are made out for grant of bail in his favour.	FAC
The learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that henceforth, the petitioner would attend both cases regularly and he would not violate the conditions of bail and as a last chance, sympathy may be shown to the petitioner and he may be granted bail.	ARG_PETITIONER
He submits that petitioner's father is seriously ill and there is nobody to look after his father.	ARG_PETITIONER
Hence, he prays for allowing the petition by granting bail to the petitioner.	ARG_PETITIONER
4. Learned HCGP opposes the bail petition on the ground that petitioner has violated conditions of bail on more than one occasion and therefore the Sessions Court was justified in rejecting his bail application.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Therefore, he submits that if the petitioner is granted bail, he would repeat the same thing and he would not appear before the Trial Court.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Therefore, he sought for rejection of the bail petition.	ARG_RESPONDENT
 5. As already stated, there are two cases registered by the police against the petitioner in Crime Nos.27/2003 and 137/2003.	ANALYSIS
Crime No.27/2003 is registered as CC No.1854/2016 whereas Crime No.137/2003 is registered as CC No.1750/2016 and both are pending on the file of the Jurisdictional Magistrate.	ANALYSIS
It is an admitted case of the petitioner that he has violated the conditions of bail in both cases.	ANALYSIS
Consequently the Jurisdictional Magistrate has cancelled the bail in both the cases.	ANALYSIS
Therefore, he had filed two bail petitions in Criminal Misc. Case Nos.743/2016 and 779/2016.	ANALYSIS
Criminal Misc. Case No.743/2016	ANALYSIS
came up consideration before II Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangaluru the learned Judge allowed the petition and granted bail considering the case of the petitioner sympathetically on the ground that his father is seriously ill.	ANALYSIS
Whereas, Criminal Misc. Case Nos.779/2016 came up consideration before the III Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangaluru.	ANALYSIS
The learned Judged viewed violation of condition of bail by the petitioner very seriously and cancelled bail granted to the petitioner in both the cases.	ANALYSIS
Considering the fact that petitioner's father is seriously ill, he has been granted bail in one case and request for bail was rejected in another case.	RATIO
Unless he is granted bail in another case also bail granted to him in Criminal Misc. Case No.743/2016 would not enure to his benefit.	RATIO
Therefore, I deem it just and proper to grant bail to the petitioner in the other case also.	RATIO
6. The petition is allowed.	RPC
The petitioner is granted bail in connection with Crime No.27/2003 registered by the respondent - Police for offences punishable under Sections 14, 32 read with Section 34 of Karnataka Excise Act and pending in C.C.No.1854/2016, subject to following conditions:- i) The petitioner shall execute a bond for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) with one solvent surety for the likesum to the satisfaction of the Court below; ii) The petitioner as well as surety shall furnish proof of their address and identity along with their photos such as ration card, voter identity card, DL etc. to ensure the presence of the petitioner at the time of trial; iii) The petitioner shall not indulge in tampering the prosecution witnesses in any manner; iv) The petitioner shall attend the concerned Court on all the future dates of hearing unless he is prevented from doing so for valid reasons; v) The petitioner shall not leave the jurisdiction of the concerned Court till the conclusion of the trial without permission;	RPC
