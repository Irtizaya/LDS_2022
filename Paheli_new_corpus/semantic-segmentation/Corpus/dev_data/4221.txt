 3.    The defence plea is one of complete denial and false implication.	FAC
 4.    The point for determination in this case are: (i)   	ISSUE
Whether	ISSUE
on dt.17.03.2005 the SI of police recovered and seized one plastic Jarycan containing 06 liters of I.D liquor from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused?	ISSUE
 (ii)  Whether the seized liquid is I/D liquor or not ? 	ISSUE
5.    	ARG_PETITIONER
In order to prove its case prosecution has examined only two witnesses in his behalf.	ARG_PETITIONER
Out of whom P.W.1 is the Excise Constable and P.W.2 is the independent witness of this case.	ARG_PETITIONER
On the other hand defence led no evidence in his behalf either orally or documentary.	ARG_PETITIONER
6.    P.W.1, the Excise constable in this case has stated that on 17.03.2005 while he along with other staffs were performing patrolling duty at Sec- 1 Kalyani nagar area, they conducted raid to the house of the accused.	ARG_PETITIONER
On search, some specious liquid was recovered from a plastic jarican in his possession.	ARG_PETITIONER
Then the SI conducted blue litmus paper test which turned into red and also conducted hydrometer chart.	ARG_PETITIONER
From the above test the SI conformed it to be nothing but 06 liters of ID liquor.	ARG_PETITIONER
On demand he unable to show any document and authority to possess the same.	ARG_PETITIONER
After that the informant seized the same.	ARG_PETITIONER
Then he collected sample liquor and destroyed the rest at the spot.	ARG_PETITIONER
After completion of enquiry the P.R U/s-47(a) B & O Excise Act against the accused to face his trial in the court of law.	ARG_PETITIONER
 7.    The learned defence counsel vehemently urged that when the plastic jar was not produced in the court, when chemical test was not done when SI has not made any test at the spot, neither he nor the S.I is an expert to test the liquor, more over when in no form the liquid was examined by him, when there is no malakhan entry for the seized material when no batch of the seized articles was specified on the charge sheet when no conscious possession of contraband by the accused is proved.	ARG_RESPONDENT
No seizure list was examined by the prosecution and no independent witness has supported the prosecution to prove the same.	ARG_RESPONDENT
It is further argued that the only witness examined by the prosecution is the official witness and to appreciate the evidence of official witness great care has to be given by the court.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Hence it is found that prosecution has significantly failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt against the accused and as such the case is entitled for a clear acquittal controvert the submission of the defence counsel the learned APP submitted that none prosecution of the seized article in the court and none examination of the independent witness is not fatal for prosecution.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Accordingly he prays to convict of the accused.	ARG_RESPONDENT
8.            	ANALYSIS
It is settled in law that such type of cases have to prove beyond all suspicion that is the liquid is seized from exclusive & conscious possession of the accused and the liquid is nothing but ID liquor.	ANALYSIS
For proving the first point that is conscious possession of the contraband I had examined the evidence of P.Ws.1 who has stated that the liquor was seized from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.	ANALYSIS
But no independent witness has support the prosecution to prove the same.	ANALYSIS
 9.            For proving the second point that is the seized liquor was I.D liquor and nothing other than it scrutinized the evidence of P.W.1, the informant of the case.	ANALYSIS
He also admitted that he had not mentioned any batch no. in the seizure list, station diary had not seized by him of the case and no malakhana entry was done in the malakhana registered relating to the seized article.	ANALYSIS
 10.           Considering the above facts and circumstances of the case I came to the conclusion that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts and as such I hold that the accused is found not guilty of the offence punishable U/s-47(a) B & O Excise Act and he is acquitted thereof as per the provision of Section 248(1) of Cr.P.C.	RATIO
The accused be set at liberty forthwith and his bail bond stands cancelled.	RPC
 The seized sample bottle be destroyed after expiry of four months period of limitation of appeal, if no appeal is preferred and in case of appeal as per the orders of the Appellate Court. Enter this case as a mistake of fact.
