The plaintiff has filed this suit against the defendants for the relief of ejectment directing the defendants to hand over vacant possession of the suit schedule property, recovery of arrears of rent of Rs.4,29,900/- and damages for illegal occupation. 2.	FAC
The case of the plaintiff in brief are as follows:-	FAC
The plaintiff has contended that the defendant is the tenant of the suit schedule property under late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan s/o late Dr. Ahamed Hussain Khan, who had given GPA to his brother Mohammed Jamal Khan to look after the schedule premises.	FAC
On 1-8-1995, the defendant agreed to pay rent at Rs.2282/- with increase of rent at 15% once in three years and paying rents to the GPA holder Mohammed Jamal Khan, as and when becomes due, the same has been made in writing on 1-9- 1996.	FAC
After death of Jamal Khan on 8th December 1996, rent was being paid to his son-in-law Dr. Syed Zakiuddin Ali from January 1997 to May 2000 by the defendant and receipts were issued.	FAC
Thereafter, defendant has stopped paying rents to Dr.Ahmedulla Khan or Dr. Syed Zakiuddin Ali.	FAC
Defendant has been informed about the death of Dr. Ahmedulla Khan, who died in May 2005.	FAC
Legal representatives of said late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan have divided the properties through registered partition deed dt.5-4-2006 and the schedule property has fallen to the share of the plaintiffs.	FAC
This fact is also made known to thed,, by providing khata of the property in their name in September 2008 and plaintiffs have demanded rents due from the defendant, but the defendant has not chosen to pay the arrears of rent to the plaintiffs.	FAC
Plaintiffs issued legal notice to the defendant stating that the schedule premises is required for the use of the plaintiffs reasonably and they have terminated the tenancy of the defendant ending on 31st October 2009 and requested the defendant to vacate and hand over the schedule premises and also demanded the arrears of rent.	FAC
The defendant sent an untenable reply but admitted that he is due rent from June 2000 to the owner of the schedule property, further contended that late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan had no issues.	FAC
Hence, this suit.	FAC
3. After registration of the suit, summons was issued to the defendant.	FAC
The defendant appeared through his counsel and filed written statement contending that the suit is not maintainable either in law or on facts.	FAC
He admitted that he is tenant under late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan.	FAC
He contended that plaintiffs have no right to claim any arrears of rent as they are strangers to the property in question.	FAC
He admitted that he is tenant under late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan under the registered Lease deed dt.27-9- 1984 and lease period was for 58 months from 1st October 1984 and initially rate of rent is Rs.1,500/- p.m.	FAC
He admitted that GPA holder of late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan Mohammed Jamal Khan used to collect the rent and defendant enhanced rent to lRs.3,000/- p.m. which was collected till May 2000.	FAC
Thereafter, said GPA holder did not turn up though defendant intended to pay rent.	FAC
Said late Dr. Ahmedulla Khan had no heirs-at-law nor legal representatives to succeed to his estate.	FAC
Without seeking the relief of declaration of title, considering the prayer of the plaintiffs does not arise.	FAC
Defendant remitted a sum of Rs.42,262/- towards assessment payable.	FAC
Plaintiffs have no enforceable rights in relation to the suit schedule property.	FAC
Defendant has never recognised the plaintiffs as his landlords.	FAC
Hence, prayed for dismissal of the suit.	FAC
4. On the basis of the above pleadings, this court has framed the following:- :: I S S U E S :: 1.	ISSUE
Whether the plaintiffs prove that they are the absolute owner of the suit schedule?	ISSUE
 2. Whether the plaintiffs prove that the defendant is a tenant under him ?	ISSUE

 7. My findings on the Issues are as under:- Issue No.1: In the affirmative.	ANALYSIS
 Issue No.2: In the affirmative.	ANALYSIS
 Issue No.3: In the affirmative.	ANALYSIS
 Issue No.4: In the negative.	ANALYSIS
 Issue No.5: Partly in the affirmative.	ANALYSIS
 Issue No.6:  As per the final order for the following: - :: R E A S O N S :: 8. ISSUE NOs.1 & 2:-  Since these Issues are interconnected with each other, they are taken up togethr in order to avoid repetition of discussion.	NONE
 9. The above pleadings show that there is an assertion from the side of the plaintiffs that the defendant is the tenant under late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan and after his death, his legal representatives have divided the property through registered Partition deed dt.5-4-2006.	ANALYSIS
This fact was made known to the defendant and the plaintiffs have demanded the rent due to them, but the defendant has not chosen to pay arrears of rent to the plaintiffs.	ANALYSIS
Hence, the plaintiffs are constrained to issue legal notice dt.31-10-2009.	ANALYSIS
The case of the defendant is that there is no relationship of landlord and tenant between himself and the plaintiffs.	ANALYSIS
The original landlord Dr. Ahamedulla Khan died and he had had no Issues.	ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs are not the legal representatives of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan.	ANALYSIS
The very title of the plaintiffs is disputed.	ANALYSIS
Hence, the suit for eviction is not maintainable without seeking the relief of declaration.	ANALYSIS
 10. In this regard, both the parties have let their evidence.	ANALYSIS
That, Pw-1 has reiterated the averments made in the plaint in his examination-in-chief affidavit and marked the original GPA executed by the other plaintiffs in her favour as Ex.P-1 to Ex.P- 5.	ANALYSIS
She also got marked the certified copy of the registered Partition deed dt.5-4-2006 executed between the plaintiffs and other legal representatives of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan at Ex.P- 6.	ANALYSIS
Other suit schedule property documents are marked at Ex.P- 7 & Ex.P-8, Rent Receipts as per Ex.P-9 & P-10, GPA executed by Dr. Ahamedulla Khan in favour of the Mohammed JamalKhan, who is father of plaintiffs as per Ex.P-11, Lease Agreement as per Ex.P-12 Authorisation letter to the defendant to pay rent issued by her uncle in favour of her father as per Ex.P-13, Title deed dt.31-8-1994 issued by Mysore Urban Development Authority to late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan as Ex.P-14, Ex.P-15 is Genealogical tree, Ex.P-16 is Family survival members certificate, Declarations made by Obedulla Khan,Dr. Rahamth Ulla Khan and Taj Unnissa as Ex.P-17 to Ex.P-19, Death certificates of Mohammed Jamal Khan, Dr. Ahmed Ulla Khan andDr. Zameela Begum Nayira, as Ex.P-20 to Ex.P-22.	ANALYSIS
 11. An attempt was made to elicit something in the cross- examination of Pw-1, but she successfully withstood the test of cross-examination.	ANALYSIS
Though Dw-1 has reiterated the written statement averments in his examination-in-chief, but in the cross-examination, the learned Counsel for the plaintiffs has elicited some important admissions and the same will be discussed at a later point of time.	ANALYSIS
 12. Dw-1 got marked the cheque book as Ex.D-1, 16 rent paid receipts as Ex.D-2 to Ex.D-17, Notice dt.30-11-2004issued by the Mysore City Corporation as Ex.D-18, Tax paid receipt dt.10- 1-2005 as Ex.D-19, Accounts extract of the defendant as Ex.D- 20, Paper publication dt.11-12-2004 in Vijaya Karnataka daily newspaper as Ex.D-21 and Ex.D-21(a).	ANALYSIS
13. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs has argued that, the suit schedule property fallen to the share of the plaintiffs through registered Partition deed dt.5-4-2006.	ARG_PETITIONER
After coming to know of this fact also, the defendant did not pay arrears of rent.	ARG_PETITIONER
Hence, the tenancy was duly terminated on 31-10-2009.	ARG_PETITIONER
 14. Per contra, the learned Counsel for the defendant has filed written arguments admitting the jural relationship between him and late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan.	ARG_RESPONDENT
He further contended that he demise of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan during May 2005 was informed to the defendant is disputed and registered partition deed is not a sustainable document.	ARG_RESPONDENT
There was no heirs to Dr.Ahamedulla Khan.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The allegation of the plaintiffs that the property came to be recorded in the names of the plaintiffs is also disputed by the defendant.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Plaintiffs have no right to claim any arrears as they are strangers.	ARG_RESPONDENT
As there is no relationship of landlord and tenant between himself and the plaintiffs, the suit of the plaintiffs is not maintainable.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Without considering the right of the plaintiffs in the absence of any suit and decree from the competent Court of law, plaintiffs are not entitled to any of the reliefs.	ARG_RESPONDENT
From these construction of the parties and documents, the fact remains is that whether the tenant can deny title of the landlord.	ARG_RESPONDENT
 15.  With these contentions taken up by the parties, I have perused the pleadings, evidence and other materials on record.	ANALYSIS
 Plaintiffs have contended that the suit schedule property fallen to their share through registered partition deed dt.5-4-2006.	ANALYSIS
It is the case of the plaintiffs that late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan is the landlord and defendant is the tenant under the plaintiff.	ANALYSIS
Dr. Ahamedulla Khan had given GPA to his brother Mohammed Jamal Khan in respect of the the suit schedule property and the defendant agreed to pay rent at the rate of Rs.2282/- with an increase of rent at 15% once in three years.	ANALYSIS
Accordingly, defendant was paying rent to the GPA holder Mohammed Jamal Khan.	ANALYSIS
The claim is not disputed by the defendant.	ANALYSIS
After the demise of Mohammed Jamal Khan, the rent was being paid to his son-in-law Syed Zakiuddin Ali from January 1997to June 2000 by the defendant and receipts were issued.	ANALYSIS
Thereafter, defendant stopped paying the rent.	ANALYSIS
Said Dr. Ahamedulla Khan died during May 2005.	ANALYSIS
The legal representatives of the deceased Dr. Ahmedulla Khan have divided the properties of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan through registered partition deed dt.5- 4-2006 and the suit schedule property has fallen to the share of the plaintiffs who are the sons and daughters of Mohammed Jamal Khan, who was the brother of late Dr. Ahamedulla Khan.	ANALYSIS
 In this case, the defendant has not disputed the landlord and tenant relationship between himself and the deceased Dr.Ahmadulla Khan.	ANALYSIS
It is the only defence of the defendant that the plaintiffs are not the legal representatives of the deceased Dr.Ahmadulla Khan.	ANALYSIS
The defendant himself in his cross- examination has admitted that the deceased Dr. Ahmadulla Khan has no issue.	ANALYSIS
At Ex.P-6 which is the registered Partition deed, the defendants and other legal representatives of Dr. Ahmadulla Khan have stated that the wife of the said Dr. Ahmadulla Khan has taken a voluntary divorce long back.	ANALYSIS
Further, defendants have produced the genealogical tree which is marked at Ex.P-15 shows that plaintiffs are also legal heirs of the deceased Dr.Ahmadulla Khan.	ANALYSIS
The other legal representatives of Dr.Ahmadulla Khan have also filed declaration at Ex.P-17 to Ex.P-19 stating that the suit schedule property originally belongs to their brother Dr. Ahmadulla Khan and he died leaving behind him, the defendants and themselves as his legal heirs.	ANALYSIS
Ex.P-6 which is the registered Partition deed clearly shows that the plaintiffs and other legal heirs of the deceased Dr. Ahmadulla Khan have divided the properties of Dr. Ahmadulla Khan and the suit schedule property fallen to the share of the plaintiffs.	ANALYSIS
 16. It is further defence of the defendant that he has disputed the title of the plaintiffs over the suit schedule propert, hence, the suit for eviction without seeking the relief of declaration is not maintainable.	ANALYSIS
17.  Where a tenant with full knowledge of the fats, either expressly or in writing or impliedly by acts, such as the payment of rent, attorns tenant to a person other than his original landlord or one who is claiming the estate of interest of such original landlord by assignment, succession, or othewise, he is ordinarily estopped from questioning the title of the person to whom he has so attorned.	ANALYSIS
Under Section 116 of the Indian Evidence Act, the tenant is estopped from questioning the title of the landlord.	ANALYSIS
Hence, the defendant is precluded from question title of the landlord on the general principles of estoppel between landlord and tenant.	ANALYSIS
Hence, the defence of the defendant is not maintainable.	ANALYSIS
18. The defendant in his cross-examination has admitted that he stopped paying rent from June 2000.	ANALYSIS
Admittedly, the original landlord Dr. Ahmedulla Khan died in the year 2005.	ANALYSIS
But the defendant has not put forward his steps to deposit the rent before the Court and to pay the rent to Dr. Ahmedulla Khan.	ANALYSIS
 The very act of the defendant itself shows that he is making false claim.	ANALYSIS
The acts of the plaintiffs by adducing oral and documentary evidence have established their case that, they are the absolute owners of the suit schedule property, by virtue of Partition deed dt.5-4-2006 and defendant is tenant under them.	ANALYSIS
Accordingly, I answer Issue Nos.1 & 2 in the affirmative.	ANALYSIS
 19. ISSUE NO.3:-	ANALYSIS
This Issue is framed with respect to termination of tenancy by issuing legal notice.	ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs have asserted that the notice dt.16-10-2009 issued to the defendant terminating the tenancy on 31-10-2009 is valid under law.	ANALYSIS
Of- course, there is no dispute with regard to issuance of such notice in favour of the defendant and the defendant has given reply to the said notice.	ANALYSIS
While answering Issues-1 & 2 have concluded that the plaintiffs are the absolute owners of the suit schedule property and defendant is tenant under them.	ANALYSIS
Said notice was issued on 16-9-2009 which is marked at Ex.P-24 which was served on the defendant on 22-9-2009.	ANALYSIS
The acknowledgement for the same is marked as Ex.P-25 and the defendant has also issued reply dt.15-10-2009 as per Ex.P-26.	ANALYSIS
The plaintiff has called upon the defendant to vacate the deliver vacant possession by the end of tenancy month 31-10-2009.	ANALYSIS
The plaintiff in the notice has clearly stated that the tenancy was terminated by the end of 31-10-2009.	ANALYSIS
Thereafter, plaintiffs have waited for more than 15 days to file this suit.	ANALYSIS
Therefore, the said notice is in consolance with the provisions of S.106 of the Transfer of Property Act.	ANALYSIS
Accordingly, I hold that the notice dt.16-09-2009 is valid under law and I answer Issue No.3 in the affirmative.	ANALYSIS
 20. ISSUE NO.4:-	ANALYSIS
This Issue is framed with respect to arrears of rent of Rs.4,29,900/- by the defendant.	ANALYSIS
Though the defendant admitted that he stopped paying rent from June 2000, it is not the case of the plaintiffs that they have issued attornment notice to the defendant after property fallen to their share under the Partition deed dt.5-4-2006.	ANALYSIS
Plaintiffs have further contended that they have informed the defendant during September 2008 that they have acquired the property in their name, but no document is produced by the plaintiffs to show that they have issued attornment notice to the defendant.	ANALYSIS
Hence, in my opinion, the plaintiffs are not entitled for the arrears of rent till the tenancy is terminated.	ANALYSIS
Therefore, I hold that the defendant is liable to pay arrears of rent only from the date of termination of tenancy.	ANALYSIS
Accordingly, Issue-4 is answered in the negative.	ANALYSIS
 21. ISSUE NO.5:-	ANALYSIS
This Issue is framed with respect to entitlement of the plaintiffs for vacant possession of the suit schedule property from the defendant with damages.	ANALYSIS
While answering Issues-1 & 2, I have concluded that plaintiffs are the absolute owners of the suit schedule property and defendant is tenant under them.	ANALYSIS
Hence, the plaintiffs are entitled for vacant possession of the suit schedule property.	RATIO
Plaintiffs have also claimed damages from the date of termination of tenancy as defendant is in unauthorised occupation of the suit schedule property.	RATIO
The remedy of the plaintiffs is to seek damages or mesne profits from the date of termination till possession.	RATIO
At present, there is no evidence to ascertain the damages.	RATIO
Hence, Court shall order to make a separate enquiry to ascertain the damages.	RATIO
Accordingly, Issue-5 is answered partly in the affirmative.	RATIO
 22. ISSUE NO.6:-	RPC
In view of above discussion and conclusion arrive at Issues-1 to 5, I proceed to pass the following:- :: O R D E R ::	RPC
The suit of the plaintiffs is partly decreed.	RPC
 The defendant is hereby directed to vacate and hand over vacant possession of the suit schedule property to the plaintiffs within three months from the date of this judgment.	RPC
 The suit of the plaintiffs for recovery of arrears of rent is hereby dismissed.	RPC
 There shall be a separate enquiry under Or.20 Rule 12 of C.P.C. to ascertain damages or mesne profits.	RPC
Parties to bear their own costs.                           	RPC
