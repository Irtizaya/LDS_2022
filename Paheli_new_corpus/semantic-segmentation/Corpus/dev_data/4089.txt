This is the plaintiff's appeal is filed U/o IXL Rule 1 CPC against dismissal of his suit in O.S.583/2004 for declaration and permanent injunction by the Court of III Addl. Civil Judge (Jr. Dn.), Mysore vide Judgment and decree dated 09.08.2007.2.	RLC
The parties are referred as per their original rank before the trial court for the sake of convenience.	FAC
3. It is the plaintiff's case that he belongs to lingayath community and a Hindu by religion.	FAC
On 07.03.1990, he married Annapurna according to Hindu customs and traditions and has two Kum.Shushma and Karthik in the said wed lock.	FAC
The mother of the defendants filed C.Mis.135/2000 U/s 125 Cr.P.C., before the Family Court at Mysore seeking maintenance from him.	FAC
The family court gave a specific finding that the mother of the defendants is not his legally wedded wife of the plaintiff, but he was ordered to pay maintenance to the defendants herein.	RLC
His revision before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in RPFC No.8/2004 came to be dismissed with an observation that the order passed by the Family court is interim in nature and would be in force till a declaration is given by a competent civil court.	RLC
Left with no other alternative, he filed this suit for declaration and injunction.	FAC
4. The defendants represented by their mother contend in the written statement that their mother Sabeena Parveen is the legally wedded wife of the plaintiff and they are born to the plaintiff in the said wed lock.	FAC
In C.Mis.135/2000 it is held that they are the children of the plaintiff born to Sabina Parveen.	FAC
The Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka has also upheld the decision of the Family Court.	RLC
To forestall the recovery proceedings, the plaintiff has filed this suit, on frivolous grounds.	RLC
The plaintiff had married Sabeena Parveen according to Hindu Customs on 21.03.1988 at Ganesha temple, Mysore by exchanging garlands and tying Mangalasutra.	RLC
The plaintiff developed bad habits after the birth of 1st defendant and used to beat Sabeena Parveen; he even intentionally deserted them.	RLC
He threw Sabeen Parveen from the matrimonial home after she refused to give him divorce.	RLC
 5. Basing on the above pleadings, the Trial Court has framed the following: ISSUES 1.	FAC
Whether the plaintiff is entitled for declaration to the effect that there is no relation of father and children between the plaintiff and the defendants?	FAC
 2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of permanent injunction restraining the defendants from enforcing the order passed by the Hon'ble Judge, Family Court, Mysore in C.Mis No.135/2000 dated 10.12.2003?	FAC
 3. Whether this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit?	FAC
 4. What order or decree?	FAC
6. The plaintiff and his three witnesses have been examined as PW1 to PW4; Ex.P1 to Ex.P18 and Ex.P4(a), Ex.P6(a) have been marked for the plaintiff.	FAC
The defendants' mother and natural guardian has examined herself as DW1 and got marked Ex.D1 to Ex.D12. 7.	FAC
After considering all the materials placed on record and the evidence adduced by the parties, the trial court dismissed the suit by judgment and decree dated 09.08.2007.	RLC
Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiff has preferred this appeal on the following amongst other grounds: That the Trial Court has failed to appreciate the oral and documentary evidence adduced by him in proper perspective; Ex.P3 has been rejected on some flimsy grounds and the Trial court failed to note that DW1 is not an illiterate lady and she had attested her signature in English.	FAC
The evidence of PW2 is also not appreciated properly.	FAC
The Trial Court erred in relying upon Ex.P15, P17 and Ex.P18 in as much as particulars therein are not given by him.	FAC
 8. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has filed written arguments.	ANALYSIS
I have gone through the same carefully and thoroughly.	ANALYSIS
I have also given my anxious consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned Counsel for the appellant and also the respondents.	ANALYSIS
I have carefully gone through the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties before the Trial Court.	ANALYSIS
 9. The points that arise for my consideration are: 1. Whether the findings of the Trial Court on issue No.1 is just and sustainable? 2. Whether impugned Judgment and decree calls for interference?	ISSUE
 3. What order?	ISSUE
 10. My findings on the above Points are: Point No.1: In the Affirmative.	ANALYSIS
Point No.2: In the Negative.	ANALYSIS
Point No.3: As per final order for following REASONS 11.	ANALYSIS
Point No.1:	ARG_PETITIONER
The Learned Counsel appearing for the appellant vehemently canvassed that the plaintiff who is a Lingayath is married to Annapurna and has got two children in the said wed lock.	ARG_PETITIONER
The Family Court while disposing of the C.Mis. filed by the defendants' mother held that the she is not the legally wedded wife of the plaintiff.	ARG_PETITIONER
The Trail Court erred in not properly appreciating Ex.P3 sworn to by DW1 and produced before the school authorities seeking change of the defendants' father's name as `Yusuf' in the place of Suresh.	ARG_PETITIONER
DNA test was not done to confirm the paternity.	ARG_PETITIONER
12. Per contra, the Learned Counsel for the respondents supported the judgment and decree of the Trial Court.	ARG_RESPONDENT
It was contended by him that since the plaintiff has not chosen to assail the judgment in RPFC 8/2004, the finding that the defendants are the children of the plaintiff has become final.	ARG_RESPONDENT
In Ex.P3, a printed Form there is a huge blank space between the typed matter and DW1's signature, which is not even identified by anybody.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Merely because the signature is affixed in English it cannot be presumed that DW1 is a literate.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Ex.P3 is a concocted document.	ARG_RESPONDENT
 13. In the light of the above rival contentions, if the evidence on record is carefully examined, it is seen that, the question whether PW1 is married to Annapurna and has children through her is irrelevant for the purpose of this case.	ANALYSIS
The trial court thus has rightly held that the Ex.P7 to Ex.P13 are not material to the matter in issue.	ANALYSIS
 14. Further, the findings of the Family Court in C.Mis.135/00 that the mother of the defendants is not the legally wedded wife of the plaintiff has reached finality, as the said order is confirmed by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka, in RPFC No.8/2004.	ANALYSIS
Further no relief is claimed against her in the suit filed by the plaintiff.	ANALYSIS
 15. The only issue that requires to be considered is whether the defendants are the children of the plaintiff or not?	ANALYSIS
The plaintiff to discharge the burden cast upon him, relies mainly on Ex.P3 which is an affidavit sworn to by Sabeena Parveen for change of her husband's name in the school records Yousuf on the ground that it is wrongly entered as Suresh in respect of her daughter Fathimmunnisa.	ANALYSIS
 16. On perusal of Ex.P3 it is seen that there is a huge gap between the typed portion and DW1's signature which is not even identified by any Advocate.	ANALYSIS
Ex.P3 is said to have been sworn to before certain S.Sundararaja Iyengar, a Notary on 24.7.1997.	ANALYSIS
DW1 categorically states that the plaintiff admitted Fathimunnisa to C.K.C.Convent and that she has not appeared before any Notary on 24.07.1997. 17.	ANALYSIS
No doubt Ex.P6, report of the expert commissioner is to the effect that the signature of DW1 on Ex.P3 is the same as the one found on the vakalathnama and the written statement filed by DW1 on behalf of minor defendants in this case.	ANALYSIS
DW1 specifically states that the name of the first defendant's father as seen in the birth certificate Ex.P5 was entered as instructed by the plaintiff.	ANALYSIS
 18. Ex.D1 is the Certificate issued by Christ Convent, 30.1.2003 to the effect that the 1st defendant is the daughter of G.Suresh i.e., the plaintiff and that she is a student of their Institution; her date of birth is 15.9.1990 as per the school records.	ANALYSIS
Ex.D9 is the Antenatal Card issued by the Dr.B.Nirmala, a Consultant Gynecologist wherein DW1's husband's name is shown as Suresh.	ANALYSIS
DW1 has stated that this document pertains to the 1st defendant.	ANALYSIS
19. Ex	ANALYSIS
.D10 is the birth certificate in respect of the 1st defendant wherein the name of her parents is shown as Suresh and Sabeena.	ANALYSIS
Ex.D11 is the voters list extract obtained on 3.3.94 wherein the plaintiff and DW1 are shown as husband and wife.	ANALYSIS
DW1 claims that the plaintiff at the relevant point of time furnished these particulars.	ANALYSIS
 20. PW1 pleads ignorance to the suggestion that the 2nd defendant Hazira was born while he was living with DW1 in Vivekanandanagara.	ANALYSIS
He also claims to be not knowing the contents of Ex.P3 and if the signature thereon is not made by DW1.	ANALYSIS
PW1 says that he does not know who handed over Ex.P3 to School authorities.	ANALYSIS
 21. PW2, H.M. of C K C Convent unequivocally admits that in Ex.P2, the 1st defendant's father's name is entered as G.Suresh and even in the application submitted at the time of her admission it was mentioned so.	ANALYSIS
According to PW2 only during 2004, on the basis of Ex.P3 she has struck off `Suresh' in Ex.P5 and changed it as `Yusuf' that after the plaintiff brought filing of such affidavit to her knowledge.	ANALYSIS
The relevant portion of PW2's evidence reads as under: "zj Cqm 2004 g  UģP    ýzU Agvz. .B13.1.2005 gAz Ai zj AiĪ  UģP vAgvg. -3 C U Aiig vAz Pngvg JAz U Uwۮ. zj wzݥr iqĪ Aiz  zj  wzݥr AiĪ 1 wUU Cx          Cg  vAi UģPU  vg. .3 C x jU  PýzU rzã." 22.	ANALYSIS
Further PW2 states that she does not know who effected corrections in Ex.P6, which was admittedly, issued on 10.4.2000 much prior to PW2 noticing Ex.P3.	ANALYSIS
How the plaintiff came to know about existence of Ex.P3? remains unanswered.	ANALYSIS
 23. Ex.D5 is NCR issued by the SHO of Ashokapuram Police Station, Mysore to DW1 in respect of a complaint against her husband Suresha.	ANALYSIS
Ex.D8 is the endorsement issued on 1.7.2000, with respect to this complaint.	ANALYSIS
If at all the plaintiff was not at all known to DW1 as claimed, how DW1 could give his name as her husband's name or lodge a complaint against him as early as in 1990 and year 2000	ANALYSIS
has also remained unanswered.	ANALYSIS
 24. On perusal Ex.P14, it is seen that the Family Court had held that the plaintiff herein and DW1 though were residing together as husband and wife, yet DW1 could not be his legally wedded wife on account of the fact that she had remained a Muslim.	ANALYSIS
This finding has not bee set aside, varied or modified by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in RPFC. No.8/2004.	ANALYSIS
Therefore the same has reached finality.	ANALYSIS
 25. The evidence on record indicates that PW2 on being prompted by the plaintiff has struck off the plaintiff's name appearing in the 1st defendant's school records without intimating the defendants or their mother.	ANALYSIS
Ex.P3 is dated 24.7.1997, but PW2 has acted upon the same somewhere during the year 2005.	ANALYSIS
Therefore it appears that on account of his strained relationship with DW1 the plaintiff has engineered changes in the entries made in the school records.	ANALYSIS
26. Ex.P15, 17 and 18 are issued by the statutory authorities such as Election Commission, City Corporation, Mysore and these documents speak to the effect that the plaintiff and DW1 were residing together as husband and wife; and the 1st defendant was born to them.	ANALYSIS
The plaintiff is bound by his documents and cannot retract from its contents.	ANALYSIS
 27. Ex.D1, Certificate dated 30.1.2003 issued by the H.M. of C.K.C. Higher Primary School, Mysore, in respect of 2nd defendant and Ex.D4 issued by the Dy.Director of Public Instructions	ANALYSIS
clearly establish that the plaintiff is the father of the defendants. 28.	ANALYSIS
Paternity is a question of fact.	ANALYSIS
The plaintiff is just hanging on to Ex.P3 to prove his case.	ANALYSIS
Having disputed his relationship with the defendants, the plaintiff till date has not come forward to undergo DNA test.	ANALYSIS
Further the circumstances, under which Ex.P3 has come into existence being doubtful, I am of the considered view that no relationship can be placed upon Ex.P3. 29.	ANALYSIS
The Trial court by considering all the probabilities and after careful evaluation of the evidence on record has come to the right, just and proper conclusion that the plaintiff is the father of the defendants.	ANALYSIS
Therefore the point for consideration is answered in the affirmative.	ANALYSIS
 30. Point No.2:	ARG_PETITIONER
The Learned Counsel for the appellant relies upon the decision in Madhusudan Das Vs Narayani Bai & Ors. reported in AIR 1983 SC 114 wherein it is held that: "In an appeal against a Trial Court decree, when the appellate court considers an issue turning on oral evidence it must bear in mind that it does not enjoy the advantage which the trial court had in having the witnesses before it and of observing the manner in which they gave their testimony.	ARG_PETITIONER
When there is a conflict of oral evidence on any matter in issue and its resolution turns upon the credibility of the witnesses, the general rule is that the appellate court should permit the findings of fact rendered by the trial court to prevail unless it clearly appears that some special feature about the evidence of a particular witness has escaped the notice of the trial court or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to displace its opinion as to where the credibility lies." 	ARG_PETITIONER
This decision in my view is more helpful to the respondent rather than the appellant and therefore it is not applicable to the appellant's case.	ANALYSIS
 31. The decision in Bishwanath Rai Vs Sachhidanand Singh reported in AIR 1971 SC 1949 and Murarilal Vs State of M.P. reported in AIR 1980 SC 531 are in respect of section 101 and 45, 46, 373, 114 of the Evidence Act.	PRE_NOT_RELIED
These decisions are also not of any help to the appellant as this court is not after proof of authorship of Ex.P3, but only the circumstances under which it has come to existence and its genuineness.	PRE_NOT_RELIED
Similarly the decision in Mobarik Ali Ahmed Vs The state of Bombay reported in AIR 1957 SC 857 is also not applicable to the facts of this case.	PRE_NOT_RELIED
 32. For the fore going reasons I am of the considered view that the findings given by the Trial Court in the impugned judgment and decree is well founded and the same does not call for any interference.	RATIO
Accordingly point for consideration is answered in the negative.	RATIO
 33. Point No.3: In the result, I pass the following: ORDER	RPC
The Regular appeal filed under order 41 rule 1 of CPC is hereby rejected with cost of Rs.1000/-.	RPC
Send back the L.C.R.(Dictated to the stenographer, transcribed by her, corrected and then pronounced by me in open court on this, the 3rd day of October 2009). (H.R.RADHA), I Addl. Civil Judge (Sr.Dn), Mysore	NONE
