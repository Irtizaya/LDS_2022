HEADNOTE:	PREAMBLE
The appellants entrusted with the duties of carrying outimprovement schemes under the Bombay Land Improvement SchemeAct, 1942, were charged with the offence of preparing falsedocuments and committing criminal breach of trust in respectof certain amount.	PREAMBLE
It was alleged that even though no workhad been done and no amount had been disbursed they prepareddocuments 'showing the doing of the work and payment of theamount, They were convicted under s. 218 read with section34, section 477A read with section 34 and section 409 read.with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code as well as section5(2).	PREAMBLE
read with section 5(1)(d) of the Prevention, ofCorruption Act.	PREAMBLE
The High Court affirmed the conviction.	PREAMBLE
inthe appeal to this Court it was contended that after thematter had been reported to the, higher authorities therectification work was done and the money was disbursed forthe purpose for which it had been entrusted; that theconviction was bad because of non-compliance with section 5Aof the Prevention of Corruption Act; and that theprosecution was barred by time under s. 23 of the BombayLand Improvement Schemes Act, 1942.Dismissing the appeal	PREAMBLE
,HELD : (i) There is no cogent ground to disagree with thetrial court and the High Court that the accused had prepared	PREAMBLE
false documents, bad also committed criminal breach of trustand were in the discharge, of their duties guilty ofcriminal misconduct as defined in s. 5 of the Prevention ofCorruption Act.	PREAMBLE
(ii)It is no answer to a charge of criminalmisappropriation that after the matter bad been reported tothe higher authorities the accused got	PREAMBLE
the rectificationwork done or the money was subsequently disbursed for thepurpose for which it had been entrusted.	PREAMBLE
According toexplanation 1 to section 403 Indian Penal Code	PREAMBLE
a dishonestmisappropriation for a time only is "misappropriation"within the meaning of that section.	PREAMBLE
[515 D]	PREAMBLE
(iii)It is well established that cognizance of a case,has, in fact, been taken by the court on a police reportfollowing investigation conducted in breach of provisions ofsection 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the resultof the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality intheinvestigation can be shown to have brought about amiscarriage of justice.	PREAMBLE
The reason for the above dictum isthat an illegality committed during the course ofinvestigation does not effect the competence andjurisdiction of the Court to, try the accused.	PREAMBLE
Where,therefore, the trial of the case has proceeded totermination, the invalidity of the preceding investigationwould not vitiate the conviction of the accused as a resultof the trial unless the illegality in the investigation hascaused prejudice to the accused.	PREAMBLE
Since there has been nomiscarriage of justice in the present case because of thealleged non-compliance with section 5A the conviction of theappellants cannot be set aside on that score.	PREAMBLE

(iv)Sub-section (i) of the Bombay Land Improvement SchemesAct 1942 has plainly no application as it relates to anything done in the good faith.	PREAMBLE
It cannot also be saidthat the acts of the appellants in preparing false documentsand committing criminal breach of trust as also the act ofcriminal misconduct were done "under" the Bombay LandImprovement Schemes' Act within the meaning of sub-section(2).	PREAMBLE
The subsection has no application where something isdone not under the Act even though it has been done by apublic servant who has been entrusted with the duties ofcarrying improvement schemes under this Act.	PREAMBLE
The impugnedacts of the appellants was not in discharge of their dutiesunder the Act but in obvious breach and flagrant disregardof their duties.	PREAMBLE

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Khanna, J.	NONE
This is an appeal by special leave by Khandu Sonu Dhobi and Bhikanrao Rambhau Khairnar against the judgment of the Bombay High Court affirming on appeal the conviction of the appellants under section 218 read with section 34, section 477A read with section 34 and section 409 read with section 34 of Indian Penal Code as well as under section 5 (2) read with section 5 ( 1 ) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.	FAC
Sentence of rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year and a fine of Rs. 200 or in default further rigorous imprisonment for a period of two months has been awarded on each count to, the appellants..	RLC
The substantive sentences have ben ordered to run concurrently.	RLC
Dhobi appellant No. 1 was an agricultural assistant and was working under Khairnar appellant No. 2 who was agriculturalsupervisor in the soil conservation section of the Government of Maharashtra.	FAC
Dhobi was incharge of the work relating to a Bundh in block No. 13 of village Asane in Taluka Mandurbar.	FAC
The above block comprises agricultural lands bearing survey Nos. 8, 17, 18, 19 and 32 measuring 90 acres.	FAC
The Bundhs were being constructed since the year 1962.	FAC
Rectification work in respect of those Bundhs at a cost of Rs. 369.07 had to be got done by Dhobi appellant under the supervision of Khaimar appellant.	FAC
The Government sanctioned an amount of Rs. 4779 in connection with the construction of the Bundhs.	FAC
An advance amount of Rs. 5000 was received by Khaimar accused on March 2, 1966 in that connection.	FAC
Work of the value, of Rs. 4400 was done but that relating to rectification work was not done.	FAC
According to the rules of the soil conservation section, the Government spent the money in the first instance and after the report of the completion of work was received, the expenses were recovered from the landowners for whose benefit the work was done.	FAC
On March 11, 1966 Khaimar made entries in measurement book Ex. 27 showing that he had checked 28 payments and certified the, same.	FAC
Khaimar accused also stated in the entry that he had passed the measurements and paid Rs. 369.07.	FAC
Paysheets Ex. 64 were prepared by Dhobi accused and he obtained the thumb impressions and signatures of the laborers on the paysheets.	FAC
Khaimar made his initials below the thumb impressions in the paysheets.	FAC
On the last page of the paysheets, Khaimar signed a certificate according to which he had paid Rs.369.07 to PW 10 Jagan Trinibak who used to do the labour work.	FAC
Final bill Ex. 28	FAC
was also prepared on that day by the accused and the signature of Jagan Trimbak was obtained on the same.	FAC
The bill was got signed from PW 7 Ziparu Tukaram and another person as attesting witnesses.	FAC
The bill was signed thereafter by Khaimar.	FAC
Debit entry Ex. 32 of Rs.	FAC
369.07	FAC
was made by Khaimar accused in the cash book.	FAC
He also prepared work abstract Ex. 29 on April 16, 1966 and sent it to the sub-divisional soil conservation officer Nandurbar showing an expenditure of Rs. 369-07.	FAC
The case of the prosecution was that the measurement book Ex. 27, paysheets Ex. 64, final bill Ex. 28 and cash book entry Ex. 32 were false documents and were fabricated by the accused without doing any reification work on the Bundh.	FAC
The accused thus committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the amount of Rs. 369.07 in furtherance of their common intention to misappropriate government property.	FAC
According further to the prosecution case, the landowners in block No. 13 came to know of the, above, acts of the accused and they complained about it to Sarpanch Tanku Bhagwan (PW 12).	FAC
Tanku sent a telegram on April 12, 1966 to the superintending agricultural officer, Bombay division, Nasik in this connection.	FAC
A copy of the telegram wasthereafter sent by the superintending agricultural officer to divisional soil conservation officer D.S.D. Ghate (PW 1) for necessary action as well as for enquiry and report.	FAC
Chate PW went to village Asane on May 2, 1966 and inspected block No. 13.	FAC
He found that entries had been made about the payment of Rs. 369.07 in the measurement book and cash book even though no rectification work had been done.	FAC
Chate submitted his report on May 6, 1966 for proceeding departmentally against the accused.	FAC
On receipt of the above report, the superintending agricultural officer directed P.R. Inamdar (PW 1 1 ), deputy director of agricultural engineering, to go to Asane village and submit his report after personally verifying the facts.	FAC
Inamdar went with Ghate to block No. 13 in Asane village on May 11, 1966.	FAC
Both Inamdar and Ghate found that no rectification work had been done.	FAC
They did not find even a single pit in the lands in that block although, according to measurement book, 83 pits had been recently dug.	FAC
Inamdar and Ghate also met the Sarpanch and other landowners of Asane village.	FAC
Report dated May 18, 1966 was thereafter submitted by Inamdar affirming those facts.	FAC
Sarpanch Tanku sent complaint Ex. 84, in the meanwhile, on April 30, 1966 to the director of anti-corruption branch Maharashtra State stating that the accused had prepared false bill for Rs. 369.07 without doing any work and that they had misappropriated that amount.	FAC
It was also stated that attempts were being made to shield the accused.	FAC
The director of anti-corruption sent a copy of that application to Sub Inspector K. G. Patil (PW 13) who was then attached to Dhulia officse of the anticorruption branch.	FAC
Sub Inspector Patil made local enquiry and took into possession the measurement book, paysheets and cash book.	FAC
The director of anti-corruption branch directed Patil to register a case and investigate into the, matter.	FAC
Patil went to Nasik and recorded statement Ex. 79 of Inamdar PW on November 7, 1966.	FAC
The statement was then sent to Nandurbar Taluka police station.	FAC
A case was registered on the basis of that statement at the police station on November 8, 1966.	FAC
On November 12, 1966 sub Inspector Patil applied for permission under section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act of judicial magistrate 1st class to investigate the offence.	FAC
The permission was granted by the judicial magistrate 1st class Nandurbar on the same day.	FAC
Patil thereafter recorded statements of a number of persons.	FAC
Patil was subsequently transferred and the case was investigated by his successors Mahamuni and Kulkarni who also obtained the requisite permission.	FAC
Sanction Ex. 97 for the prosecution of the two accused was granted under section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act by the superintending agricultural officer Bombay division, Nasik on May 18, 1967.The	FAC
two accused in their statements admitted that the work of the value of Rs. 369.07 wasnot done till March 11, 1966 although it was so stated in the various documents by them.	FAC
The accused also admitted that no amounts were paid to any of the labourers mentioned in the paysheets although signatures and thumb impressions of the labourers had been obtained on the paysheets on March 11, 1966.	FAC
According to the accused, they had prepared the various documents in accordance with the instructions of Ghate PW who was insisting in March 1966, and even earlier, that a completion report relating to block No. 13 be sent as the entire amount spent on that block since 1962 could not be recovered for want of a. completion report	FAC
. Khaimar accused added that rectification work had been done between May 13, 1966 and May 16, 1966 and the amount of Rs. 369.07 was thereafter disbursed on May 16, 1966.	FAC
The learned special judge held that the amount of Rs. 369.07 had not been paid by the two accused to the labourers.	RLC
No work, it was found, had been done and the different documents prepared by the accused in this connection were false even on their own admissions.	RLC
The explanation furnished by the accused that they prepared false documents at the instance of Ghate and got work done thereafter was not accepted.	RLC
Objection was raised on behalf of the accused that the investigation of the case was illegal and that prosecution was barred by time under the pro-visions of section 23 of the Land Improvement Schemes Act, 1942.	FAC
These objections were repelled.	FAC
The accused were accordingly convicted and sentenced as above.	FAC
On appeal the High Court affirmed the, findings of the learned special judge.	FAC
We have heard Mr. Kotwal on behalf of the, appellants and are of the opinion that there is no merit in the appeal.	ANALYSIS
It has not been disrupted before us that the accused made various entries and prepared documents on March 11, 1966 about their having got the rectification work done as well as about the payment of Rs. 369.07 on that account.	ANALYSIS
It has also not been disputed before us that the amount of Rs. 369- 07 was not paid to any one by the accused in March or April 1966.	ANALYSIS
According to Ghate (PW 1) and Inamdar (PW 11), no work relating to the rectification of the Bundh was found to have been done till May 11, 1966 when they visited the site in question.	ANALYSIS
Inamdar's evidence also shows that according to the measurement book prepared by the accused, 83 pits had been recently dug although the witness could not find a single pit on the spot.	ANALYSIS
In view of the above, we find no cogent ground to disagree with the trial court and the High Court that the accused had prepared false documents and had also committed criminal breach of trust in respectof the amount of Rs. 369.07.	ANALYSIS
We also agree with the trial court and the High Court that the accused were in the discharge of their duties guilty of criminal misconduct as defined in section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.	ANALYSIS
Mr. Kotwal has argued that the accused completed the recti- fication work after May 11, 1966,.	ANALYSIS
There is, however, no direct evidence as may show that the, rectification work was completed' after May 11, 1966.	ANALYSIS
Even if it may be assumed that the accused completed the rectification work in May 1966, that fact, in our opinion, would not absolve the accused of their criminal liability.	ANALYSIS
The charge, against the accused relates to preparation of false documents because even though no work had been done till March 11, 1966 and no amount had been disbursed, they prepared docu- ments showing the doing of that work and the payment of that amount.	ANALYSIS
It is no answer to, that charge that after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities, the accused in the month of May 1966 got the rectification work done.	ANALYSIS
It is also no answer to a charge of criminal misappropriation that the money was subsequently, after the matter had been reported to the high authorities, disbursed for the purpose for which it had been entrusted.	ANALYSIS
According to explanation 1 to section 403 Indian Penal Code, a dishonest misappropriation for a time only is "misappropriation " within the meaning of that section.	ANALYSIS
Mr. Kotwal has also submitted that the accused expressed willingness to complete the work after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities.	ANALYSIS
This submission, 'even if accepted, would not exonerate the accused because the willingness after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities could not efface or undo the offence earlier committed by the accused.	ANALYSIS
Argument has then been advanced on behalf of the appellants that Sub Inspector Patil did not make investigation in the case in accordance with law.	ANALYSIS
It is urged that permission to make investigation was granted to Sub Inspector Patil on November 12, 1966 and, as such, he was not authorized to make before that date the enquiry which led to the registration of the case as that enquiry partook of the character of investigation.	ANALYSIS
Nothing has been brought to our notice as to how an enquiry before the registration of a case can be held to be investigation.	ANALYSIS
The matter, however, need not be dilated upon and it is not necessary to express any final opinion in the matter because we find that there is no material on the record as may show that the accused were prejudiced because of the alleged non-compliance with the provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act.	ANALYSIS
It is well established that where cxognizance of a case has, in fact, been taken by the court on a police report following investigationconducted in breach of provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the result of the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice.	ANALYSIS
The underlying reason for the above dictum is that an illegality committed in the course of investigation does not affect the competence and jurisdiction of the court to try the accused.	ANALYSIS
Where, therefore, the trial of the case has proceeded to termination, the invalidity of the proceeding investigation would not vitiate the conviction of the accused as a result of the trial unless the illegality in the investigation has caused prejudice to the accused (see H. N. Rishbud and Inder Singh v. The State of DelHi(1)].	PRE_RELIED
Since there has been no miscarriage of justice in the present case because of the alleged non-compliance with section 5A, the conviction of the accused appellants cannot be set aside on that score.	ANALYSIS
For the same reason, we are unable to accede to the contention of Mr. Kotwal that the conviction of the accused should be set aside because permission under section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act to SI Patil for investigation of the offence was granted in a ,casual manner and without the existence of sufficient reasons.	ANALYSIS
 Lastly, it has been argued by Mr. Kotwal that the prosecution of the accused was barred by time under section 23 of the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes, Act, 1942.	ANALYSIS
The section reads as under "(1) No suit, prosecution or other legal proceeding shall be instituted against any public servant or person duly authorized under this Act in respect of anything in good faith done or intended to be done under this Act or the rules made thereunder.                         (2)No suit or prosecution shall be instituted against any public servant or person duly authorized under this Act in respect of anything done or intended to be done, under this Act, unless the, suit or prosecution has been instituted within six months from the date of the act complained of."Sub-section (1) of the section has plainly no application as it relates to anything done in good faith.	STA
According to Bombay General Clauses Act, a thing shall be deemed to be done in good faith where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not.	ANALYSIS
The appellants admittedly were not acting honestly when they prepared the false documents in question and showed disbursement of Rs.369.07 on March 11, 1966.	ANALYSIS
Mr. Kotwal, however, relies on sub-section (2) of section 23 and (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1150. submits that the prosecution could be instituted against the appellants only within six months from March 11, 1966.	ANALYSIS
As the charge sheet was submitted long after the expire of six months, the case against the accused-appellants, according to the counsel, was barred by time.	ANALYSIS
This contention, in our opinion, is devoid of force.	ANALYSIS
Sub-section (2) refers to suit or prosecution against a public servant or person duly authorized under the Act in respect of anything done or intended to be done under the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes Act.	ANALYSIS
It cannot be said that the acts of the accused-appellants in preparing false documents and in committing criminal breach of trust in respect of the amount of Rs. 369-07 as also their act of criminal misconduct were done under the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes Act.	ANALYSIS
Sub- section (2) of section 23 deals with anything done or intended to be done under the above mentioned Act by a public servant or a person duly authorized under the Act.	ANALYSIS
 It has no application where something is done not under the Act even though it has been done by a public servant who has been entrusted with duties of carrying out improvement schemes under the above mentioned Act.	ANALYSIS
The impugned acts of the appellants in the present case were not in discharge of their duties under the above mentioned Act but in obvious breach and flagrant disregard of their duties.	RATIO
Not only they did no rectification work for the Bundh which was a part of the improvement scheme, they also misappropriated the amount which had been entrusted to them for the purpose of rectification.	RATIO
 Prayer has also been made for the reduction of the sentence, but we see no cogent ground to interfere with the same.	RPC
The appeal consequently fails and is dismissed.	RPC
 K.B.N.                     Appeal dismissed. 5--L1031 Sup.CI/72	NONE
