PREAMBLE
The Income-tax officer includedthe prize money in his income for the relevant assessmentyear relying upon the definition of 'income'in clause (24)of Section 2 of Income Tax Act.	PREAMBLE
On an appeal preferred by the respondent-assessee theAppellate Assistant Commissioner held that as the Rally wasnot a race, the prize money cannot be treated as incomewithin the meaning of section 2(24) (ix).	PREAMBLE
The Tribunal onan appeal by the Revenue, held that the Rally was not a raceand as it was a test of skill and endurance, it was not a'game' within the meaning of Sec. 2 (24) (ix).	PREAMBLE
As the prizemoney received was casual in nature it fell outside Sec.10(3) of the Act.	PREAMBLE
The High Court on a reference at the instance of theRevenue,upholding the findings of the Tribunal,observed thatthe expression 'winnings' cannotes money won by betting orgambling and therefore the prize money not represent'winnings'.	PREAMBLE
Inasmuch as the amount in question was obtainedby participating in a rally which involved skill in drivingthe vehicle, it held, it cannot he included in theassessee's income, also because it fell outside the previewof s.10 (3).Allowing the Appeal, the Court,HELD:1.	PREAMBLE
The expression 'income' must be construed in itswidest sense.	PREAMBLE
The definition of 'income' is an inclusiveone.	PREAMBLE
Even if a receipt does not fall within sub-clause (ix)or any of the sub-clauses of Sec.2(24) of the Act	PREAMBLE
it may yetconstitute income.	PREAMBLE
Hence the prize-money received by therespondentassessee constitutes 'income' -as defined in clause (24) ofSection 2 of the Act. (335-C)2.The High Court erred in reading several sub-clauses inSec. 2(24) as exhaustive when the statute expressly saysthat the definition is inclusive.	PREAMBLE
Even if a receipt doesnot fall within the ambit of any of the sub-clauses in Sec.2(24) it may still he income if it partakes of the nature ofincome.	PREAMBLE
The idea behind providing inclusive definition inSec. 2(24) is not to limit its meaning but to widen its net.	PREAMBLE
This Court has repeatedly said that the word 'income' is ofwidest amplitude and that it must he given its natural andgrammatical meaning.	PREAMBLE

3.If the monies which are not earned in the true sense ofthe word Constitute income, it is difficult to appreciatewhy do monies earned by skill and to not constitute income?	PREAMBLE
The Rally was a contest, if not a race.	PREAMBLE
The Respondent-assessee entered the contest to win it.	PREAMBLE
The Prize-moneywhich he got in return for winning the contest was a rewardfor his skill and endurance.	PREAMBLE
It does constitute his income-which expression must be construed in its widest sense.(335-B)4.The	PREAMBLE
sub-clause (ix) of Sec. 2(24), is not confined togames of gambling nature alone.	PREAMBLE
Some of them are games ofskill.	PREAMBLE

5.As the definition of income in Sec. 2(24) is an inclusiveone, its ambit should be the same as that of the word'income' occurring in Entry 82 of list 1 of the SeventhSchedule of the Constitution of India.	PREAMBLE
(334-B)	PREAMBLE
6.Even casual income is 'income'as is evident from Sec.10(3).	PREAMBLE
A casual receipt which should mean in the context,casual income-is liable to be included in the total income,if it is in excess of Rs. 1,000 by virtue of clause (3)of Sec. 10.	PREAMBLE
The Tribunal erred in its finding that theprize money fell outside the purview of Sec. 10 (3) inspiteof holding that the receipt in question was casual innature.	PREAMBLE

JUDGMENT:CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 3908 (NT)/ 1983.	NONE

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by B.P. JEEVAN REDDY, J.	NONE
This appeal is preferred against the Judgment of the Madras High Court answering the question referred to it in the affirmative i.e., in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue.	FAC
The question referred under section 256 (1) of the Income-tax Act reads as follows: "Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that the total sum of Rs. 22.000 received by the assessee from the Indian Oil Corporation and All India Highway Motor Rally should not be brought to tax?"	ISSUE
The assessment year concerned is 1974-75.	FAC
The assessee, G.R. Karthikeyan, assessed as an individual, was having income from various sources including salary and business income.	FAC
During the accounting year relevant to the said assessment year, he participated in the All India Highway Motor Rally.	FAC
He was awarded the first prize of Rs. 20,000 by the Indian Oil Corporation and another Sum of Rs. 2,000 by the All India Highway Motor Rally.	FAC
The Rally was organised jointly by the Automobile Association of Eastern India and the Indian Oil Corporation and was supported by several Regional Automobile Associations as well as Federation of Indian Motor Sports Clubs and the Federation of Indian Automobile Associations.	FAC
The rally was restricted to private motorcars, the length of the rally route was approximately 6,956 kms.	FAC
One could start either from Delhi, Calcutta, Madras or Bombay, proceed anti-clock wise and arrive at the starting point.	FAC
The rally was designed to test endurance driving and the reliability of the automobiles.	FAC
One had to drive his vehicle observing the traffic regulations at different places as also the regulations prescribed by the Rally Committee.	FAC
Prizes were awarded on the basis of overall classification.	FAC
The method of ascertaining the first prize was based on a system of penalty points for various violations.	FAC
The competitor with the least penalty points was adjudged the first-prize winner.	FAC
On the above basis, the assessee won the first prize and received a total sum of Rs. 22,000.	FAC
The Income Tax Officer included the same in the income of the respon- dent-assessee relying upon the definition of 'income' in clause (24) of section 2.	FAC
On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that inasmuch as the rally was not a race, the amount received cannot be treated as income within the meaning of section 2 (24) (ix).	FAC
An appeal preferred by the Revenue was dismissed by the Tribunal.	RLC
The Tribunal recorded the following findings: (a)That the said rally was not a race. It was predominantly a test of skill and endurance as well as of reliability of the vehicle.(b) That the rally was also not a 'game' within the meaning of section 2(24) (ix).(c) That the receipt in question was casual in nature.	RLC
It was nevertheless not an income receipt and hence fell outside the provisions of section 10 (3) of the Act.	RLC
3. At the instance of the Revenue, the question aforementioned was stated for the opinion of the Madras High Court.	RLC
The High Court held in favour of the assessee on the following reasoning: (a) The expression 'winnings' occuring at the inception of sub-clause (ix) in section 2(24) is distinct and different from the expression 'winning'.	RLC
The expression 'winnings' has acquired a connotation of its own.	RLC
It means money won by gambling or betting.	RLC
The expression 'winnings' controls the meaning of several expressions occurring in the sub- clause.	RLC
In this view of the matter, the sub-clause cannot take in the receipt concerned herein which was received by the assessee by participating in a race which involved skill in driving the vehicle.	RLC
The rally was not a race.	RLC
In other words the said receipt does not represent 'winnings'.	RLC
(b) A perusal of the memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill,. 1 972, which inserted the said sub- clause in section 2(24), also shows that the idea behind the sub-clause was to rope in windfalls from lotteries, races and card games etc.(c)	RLC
Section 74 (A) which too was introduced by the Finance Act, 1972 supports the said view.	RLC
Section 74 (A) provides that any loss resulting from any of the sources mentioned therein can be set off against the income received from that source alone.	RLC
The sources referred to in the said section are the very same sources mentioned in sub-clause (ix) of section 2(24) namely lotteries, crossword puzzles, races including horse races, card games etc.	RLC
The correctness of the view taken by the High Court is questioned herein.	ISSUE
The definition of 'income' in section 2(24) is an inclusive definition.	ANALYSIS
The Parliament has been adding to the definition by adding sub-clause (s) from time to time.	ANALYSIS
Sub- clause (ix) which was inserted by the Finance Act, 1972 reads as follows: "(ix) any winnings from lotteries, crossword puzzles, races including horse races, card games and other games of any sort or from gambling or betting of any form or nature whatsoever;"	STA
We may notice at this stage a provision in section IO.	ANALYSIS
Section 10 occurs in chapter HI which carries the heading "Incomes which do not form part of total income".	STA
Section 10 in so far as is relevant reads thus: " 10, Incomes not included in total income: In computing the total income of a previous year of any person, any income failing within any of the following clauses shall not be included: (d) any receipts which are of a casual and non recurring nature, not being winnings from lotteries, to the extent such receipts do not exceed one thousand rupees in the aggregate".	STA
(The clause has been amended by Finance Act, 1986 but we are not concerned with it.	ANALYSIS
Similarly it is not necessary to notice the proviso to the said clause.)	ANALYSIS
It is not easy to define income.	ANALYSIS
The definition in the Act is an inclusive one.	ANALYSIS
As said by Lord Wright in Kamakshya Narayan Singh v. C.I.T. 11 I.TR. 513 P. C."income............. is a word difficult and perhaps impossible to define in any precise general formula.	PRE_RELIED
It is a word of the broadest connotation".	PRE_RELIED
In Gopal Saran Narain Singh v. Commissioner of Income Tax 3.I.T.R. 237 P.C., the Privy Council pointed out that "anything than can properly be described as income is taxable under the Act unless expressly exempted."	PRE_RELIED
This Court had to deal with the ambit of the expression 'income'in Navin Chandra Mafatlal v. C.I T.Bombay 26 I.T.R. (S.C.)The Indian Income-tax and Excess Profits Tax (Amendment) Act, 1947	PRE_RELIED
had inserted section 12 (B) in the Indian Income- tax Act, 1922.	PRE_RELIED
Section 12(B) imposed a tax on capital gains.	PRE_RELIED
The validity of the said Amendment was questioned on the ground that tax on capital gains is not a tax on 'income'within the meaning of entry 54 of list-1, nor is it a tax on the capital value of the assets of individuals and companies within the meaning of entry-55, of list- 1 of the seventh schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935.	PRE_RELIED
The Bombay High Court repelled the attack.	PRE_RELIED
The matter was brought to this Court.	PRE_RELIED
After rejecting the argument on behalf of the assessee that the word 'income' has acquired, by legislative practice, a restricted meaning-and after affirming that the entries in the seventh schedule should receive the most liberal construction-the Court observed thus: "What.	PRE_RELIED
then, is the ordinary, natural and grammatical meaning of the word "income"?	PRE_RELIED
According to the dictionary it means "a thing that comes in."	PRE_RELIED
(See Oxford Dictionary, Vol. V,p. 162; Stroud, vol.II, pp. 14-16).	ANALYSIS
In the United States of America and, in Australia both of which also are English speaking countries the word "income is understood in a wide sense so as to include a capital gain.	ANALYSIS
Reference may be made to- 'Eisner v. Macomber', [1919] 252 US 189 (K); -'Merchants' Loan and Trust Co. v.                         'Smietanka'[1920] 255 US 509 ( L) and -'United States of America v. Stewart', [1940] 311 US 60(M) and-'Resch v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation', [1943] 66 CLR 198 (N).	PRE_RELIED
In each of these cases very wide meaning was ascribed to the word "income" as its natural meaning.	PRE_RELIED
The relevant observations of learned Judges deciding those cases which have been quoted in the judgment of Tendolkar J.quite clearly indicate that such wide meaning was put upon the word "income" not because of any particular legislative practice either in the United States or in the Commonwealth of Australia but because such was the normal concept and connotation of the ordinary English word "income".	ANALYSIS
Its natural meaning embraces any profit or gain which is actually received.	ANALYSIS
This is in consonance with the observations of Lord Wright to which reference has already been made.	ANALYSIS
The argument founded on an assumed legislative practice being thus out of the way, there can be no difficulty in applying its natural and grammatical meaning to the ordinary English word "income'.	ANALYSIS
As already observed, the word should be given its widest connota-tion in view of the fact that it occurs in a legislative head conferring legislative power.	ANALYSIS
8. Since the definition of income in section 2(24) is an inclusive one, its ambit, in our opinion, should be the same as that of the word income occurring in entry 82 of list 1 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution (corresponding to entry 54 of list 1 of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act).9.	ANALYSIS
In Bhagwandas Jain v. Union of India 128 I.T.R. 315 S.C.	PRE_RELIED
The challenge was to the validity of section 23(2) of the Act which provided that where the property consists of house in the occupation of the owner for the purpose of his own residence, the annual value of such house shall first be determined in the same manner as if the property had been let and further be reduced by one half of the amount so determined or Rs. 1,800 whichever is less.	PRE_RELIED
The contention of the assessee was that he was not deriving any monetary benefit by residing in his own house and, therefore, no tax can be levied on him on the ground that he is deriving income from that house.	PRE_RELIED
It was contended that the word income means realisation of monetary benefit and that in the absence of any such realisation by the assessee, the conclusion of any amount by way of notional income under section 23(2) of the Act in the chargeable income was impermissible and outside the scope of entry 82 of list-1 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.	PRE_RELIED
The said contention was rejected affirming that the expression income is of the widest amplitude and that it includes not merely what is received or what comes in by exploiting the use of the property but also that which can be converted into income.	PRE_RELIED
 10. Sub-clause (ix) of section 2(24) refers to lotteries, crossword puzzles, races including horse races, card games, other games of any sort and gambling or' betting of any form or nature whatsoever.	STA
All crossword puzzles are not of a gambling nature.	STA
Some are; some are not.	STA
See State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala A.I.R. 1957 S.C.699.Even in card games there are some games which are games of skill without an element of gamble (See State of Andhra Pradesh v.K. Satyanarayan[1968] 2 S.C.R. 515.	PRE_RELIED
The words other games of any sort" are of wide amplitude.	ANALYSIS
Their meaning is not confined to games of a gambling nature alone.	ANALYSIS
It thus appears that sub-clause (ix) is not confined to mere gambling or betting activities.	ANALYSIS
But, says the High Court, the meaning of all.	ANALYSIS
the aforesaid words is controlled by the word 'winnings' occurring at the inception of the subclause.	ANALYSIS
The High Court says, relying upon certain material, that the expression winnings' has come to acquire a particular meaning viz, receipts from activities of a gambling or betting nature alone.	ANALYSIS
Assuming that the High Court is right in its interpretation of the expression 'winnings', does it follow that merely becausewinnings from gambling/betting activities are included within the ambit of income,the monies received from non- gambling and non-betting activities are not so included?	ANALYSIS
What is the implication flowing from insertion of clause (ix)?	ANALYSIS
If the monies which are not earned-in the true sense of the word-constitute income why do moneies earned by skill and toil not constitute income?	ANALYSIS
Would it not look odd.	ANALYSIS
if one is to say that monies received from games and races of gambling nature represent income but not those received from games and races of non-gambling nature?	ANALYSIS
The rally in question was a contest, if not a race.	ANALYSIS
The respondent- assessee entered the contest to win it and to win the first prize.	ANALYSIS
What he got was a return' for his skill and endurance.	ANALYSIS
Then why is it not income-which expression must be construed in its widest sense.	ANALYSIS
Further, even if a receipt does not fall within subclause (ix), or for that matter, any of the sub-clauses in section 2(24), it may yet constitute income.	ANALYSIS
To say otherwise, would mean reading the several clauses in section 2(24) as exhaustive of the meaning of 'income' when the Statute expressly says that it is inclusive.	ANALYSIS
It would be a wrong approach to try to place a given receipt under one or the other sub-clauses in section 2(24) and if it does not fall under any of the sub- clauses, to say that it does not constitute income.	ANALYSIS
Even if a receipt does not fall within the ambit of any of the sub- clauses in section 2(24), it may still be income if it partakes of the nature of the income.	ANALYSIS
The idea behind providing inclusive definition in section 2(24) is not to limit its meaning but to widen its net.	ANALYSIS
This Court has repeatedly said that the word 'income' is of widest amplitude, and that it must be given its natural and grammatical meaning.	ANALYSIS
Judging from the above standpoint, the receipt concerned herein is also income.	ANALYSIS
May be it is causal in nature but it is income nevertheless.	ANALYSIS
That even the casual income is 'income' is evident from section 10 (3).	ANALYSIS
Section 10 seeks to exempt certain 'incomes' from being included in the total income'.	ANALYSIS
A casual receipt which should mean, in the context, casual income is liable to be included in the total income if it is in excess of Rs.1,000, by virtue of clause (3) of section 10.	ANALYSIS
Even though it is a clause exempting a particular receipt/income to a limited extent, it is yet relevant on the meaning of the expression 'income'.	ANALYSIS
In our respectful opinion, the High Court, having found that the receipt in question does not fall within sub-clause (ix) of section 2(24), erred in concluding that it does not constitute income.	ANALYSIS
The High Court has read the several sub-clauses in section 2(24) as exhaustive of the definition of income when in fact it is not so.	ANALYSIS
In this connection it is relevant to notice the finding of the Tribunal.	ANALYSIS
It found that the receipt in question was casual in nature but-it opined-it was nevertheless not an income receipt and fell outside the provision of section 10 (3) of the Act.	ANALYSIS
We have found it difficult to follow the logic behind the argument.	ANALYSIS
11. For the above reasons we hold that the receipt in question herein doesconstitute 'income' as defined in clause (24) of section 2 of the Act.	RPC
The appeal is accordingly allowed and the question referred by the Tribunal under section 256(1) of the Act is answered in the negative i.e., in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.	RPC
There shall be no order as to costs.	RPC
RSK.Appeal allowed.	RPC
