 1.  The above, named accused persons, stand prosecuted for commission of offence under Sections 341/323/294/506/34 of Indian Penal Code (herein after referred to as "the I.P.C.").	FAC
 2.            The story of the prosecution, in brief, is that on dated 13.11.2009 the informant Madhusudan Chhatria appeared at Kinjirkela PS and lodged a written report alleging therein that on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM, when he was coming out of his house then the accused persons abused him in obscene words such as " TU KI BANDAR MEMBER " and also assaulted him as a result of which he sustained injuries on his person.	FAC
Thereafter he lodged the FIR at the police station.	FAC
Basing upon such report the present case was registered.	FAC
The investigation of the case was started.	FAC
After completion of investigation the IO submitted charge sheet U/s 341/323/294/506/34 of IPC against the accused persons to face their trial in the Court of Law.	FAC
Hence this case.	FAC
3.            	ARG_RESPONDENT
The plea of the deence is one of complete denial and false implication.	ARG_RESPONDENT
4. The points for determination in this case are as follows:-	ISSUE
i)        Whether on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM , in front of the house of the informant, the accused persons in furtherance of common intention wrongfully restrained the informant Madhusudan Chhatria on his way in which he has right to proceed ?	ISSUE
 ii)       Whether on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM , in front of the house of informant , the accused persons in furtherance of common intention, voluntarily caused hurt to the informant Madhusudan Chhatria ?	ISSUE
 iii) Whether on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM, in front of the house of informant, the accused persons in furthrance of common intention abused the informant Madhusudan Chhatria in in obscene words such as "TU KI BANDAR MEMBER " in or near a public place causing annoyance to him and others ?	ISSUE
ii)       Whether on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM, in front of the house of informant, the accused persons in furtherance of common intention committed criminal intimation by threatening the informant Madhusudan Chhatira to kill him in life with an intent to cause alarm to him?	ISSUE
 5.      In order to substantiate its case, the prosecution has examined five witnesses, out of whom, P.W.2 is the informant of this case, P.W.1 is the doctor. P.W.3 Is the wife of P.W.2.	FAC
P.W.4 and P.W.5 are the independent witnesses.	FAC
On the other hand, no-one was examined on behalf of the defense.	FAC
 6.                So far as the present case is concerned. P.W.2, the informant of this case deposed that he knows the accused persons who are his co-villagers.	FAC
He deposed that he has lodged the FIR against the accused persons due to misunderstanding and he does not want proceed anything against the accused persons as the disputes has already been amicably settled within them outside the Court.	FAC
He proved the FIR as Ext.2 and Ext.2/1 is his signature thereon.	FAC
During his cross examination he deposed that he does not want to proceed further in this case and he has a good relationship with the accused persons and now they are living peacefully forgetting their differences.	FAC
P.W.3 the wife of the informant deposed that she know the accused persons.	FAC
She further deposed that she does not know anything about this case and her husband told her that the disputes has already been amicably settled between.	FAC
Another independent witnesses who have been examined as P.W.4 and P.W.5 denied of having any knowledge regarding case matter.	FAC
Though P.W.1 the doctor of this case deposed that on dated. 14.11.2009 at about 4.45 PM he had examined the informant Madhusudan Chhhatria on police requisition and prepared his injury report vide Ext.1 but the evidence of the doctor is of no avail the case of the prosecution in absence of any ocular evidence on record.	FAC
 7.  The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused also submitted that the dispute has already been amicably settled outside the Court among themselves.	ARG_RESPONDENT
So the accused persons are entitled for a clean acquittal.	ARG_RESPONDENT
 8.  Here in this case at hand, all of the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution have not uttered a single word implicating the accused persons in this case.	ANALYSIS
Even the informant has not whispered a single word against the accused persons in this present case rather he has specifically stated that dispute has already been amicably settled between themselves.	ANALYSIS
Law is well settled that FIR is not a substantive piece of evidence and no conviction can lie only on the basis of FIR without having any corroboration from the maker thereof.	ANALYSIS
In the present case even if the Complaint /FIR (Ext.1) disclosed regarding the alleged incident committed by the accused persons on the alleged date of occurrence.	ANALYSIS
It is of no help to the case of the prosecution in absence of any evidence available on record.	ANALYSIS
 In view of the above discussion and considering the available evidence on record, I am of the view that the prosecution has not adduced a single evidence to substantiate its charge against the accused persons , hence there is absolutely no evidence on record to implicate the accused persons in the present case.	RATIO
 9.  In the result, the accused persons found not guilty for the offence U/ss 341/323/294/506/34 of I.P.C and are acquitted therefrom as per the provision of U/s 255 (1) Cr.P.C.	RPC
They be set at liberty forthwith and their bail bond be cancelled.	RPC
Enter the case "as mistake of fact".	RPC
