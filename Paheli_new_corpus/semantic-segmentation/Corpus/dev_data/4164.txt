Accused person stands charged for the offence U/s. 47(a) (i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act for illegal possession of I.D. Liquor.	FAC
 2.  The story of the prosecution in brief is that on 13.05.2015 at about 8.30 a.m., while the SI of Excise Sadar Mobile in charge of Ujalpur Charge was performing patrolling duty along with staff at Kuturma area, noticed that the accused Gauranga Kishan was coming on the road by carrying one plastic jerry cane in his hand.	FAC
On suspicion the SI of Excise detained him on the road and on search recovered seven litres of ID liquor containing in the said plastic jerry cane from the possession of the accused in presence of the witnesses.	FAC
Thereafter he conducted blue litmus test, smell test, hydrometer test and from above tests and his prolonged service experience, he ascertained that the seized article was I.D. liquor.	FAC
Then the SI of Excise has enquired into the matter and after completion of his inquiry submitted final PR against the accused person U/s. 47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act suggesting his trial.	FAC
3.            	ARG_PETITIONER
The plea of the accused person is one of complete denial and false implication only for statistical purpose.	FAC
4.            	ISSUE
The points for determination of this case are as follows: (i) Whether on 13.05.2015 at about 8.30 a.m., the road of Kuturma, the SI of Excise seized seven litres of ID liquor containing in one plastic jerry cane for the purpose of selling without any authority?	ISSUE
 (ii) Whether on the same date, time and place the said seven litres of ID liquor has been seized from your exclusive and conscious possession ?	ISSUE
 (iii) Whether the seized article is I.D. liquor or not?	ISSUE
 5.            To prove its case, prosecution has examined only three witnesses.	ANALYSIS
Out of whom P.W. 2 is the SI of Excise Sadar Mobile in charge of Ujalpur and P.W. 1 is the accompanying Excise constable.	ANALYSIS
Pw 3 is the cited independent seizure witness to the alleged occurrence.	ANALYSIS
Prosecution proved certain documents marked as Ext. 1 & Ext. 2.	ANALYSIS
On the other hand, no oral or documentary evidence adduced on behalf of accused person in his defence.	ANALYSIS
 6.  On analysis of the evidence on record P.W. 2 the SI of Excise deposed that on 13.05.2015, while he was performing patrolling duty at Kuturma area, found that the accused was coming on the road by holding one plastic jerry cane in his hand, so on suspicion, he detained the accused Gauranga Kishan and on search recovered seven litres of ID liquor containing in the plastic jerry cane from the possession of the accused.	ANALYSIS
According to this witness, he had conducted blue litmus paper test which turned into red in colour, conducted hydrometer test and thereafter prepared the seizure list.	ANALYSIS
Another official witness PW 1 (Excise constable) like wise supported the version of P.W 2 in respect of patrolling and seizure of the liquor from the possession of the accused.	ANALYSIS
Specific version of both the witnesses is that seizure was conducted by the SI of Excise in presence of the witnesses.	ANALYSIS
Hence, it is necessary to testify the testimony of the official witnesses from independent source for the sake of corroboration.	ANALYSIS
P.W. 3, the independent seizure witness did not support the version of P.W. 2 at all in respect of factum of seizure.	ANALYSIS
According to him nothing was seized in his presence by any Excise staff and he has put his thumb impression on a paper.	ANALYSIS
Hence there is discrepancy between the testimony of independent seizure witness and the official witnesses.	ANALYSIS
 7. To prove an offence U/s.47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act, it is the bounden duty of prosecution to establish that the seizure was from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.	ANALYSIS
But in this case the seizure witness did not support the factum of seizure at all.	ANALYSIS
Further the SI of Excise, PW 2 in cross-examination admitted that he had not known the accused prior to the incident.	ANALYSIS
The spot is a village road and busy one.	ANALYSIS
He further deposed that he has not produced the seized articles before the court nor he sent the same for chemical examination.	ANALYSIS
Though the independent corroboration is not the rule but as the place of seizure is a public place, examination of independent witness is necessary to make the judgment free from any criticism.	ANALYSIS
The plea of the defence is that a false case has been foisted against him only for statistical purpose.	ANALYSIS
There is no material on record to show the exact place of seizure, as no sketch map is prepared or proved by the prosecution in this case to establish that the seizure was from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.	ANALYSIS
 More so the SI of Excise neither produced the seized liquor before the court nor sent the same for chemical examination.	ANALYSIS
Further, independent seizure witness did not support the factum of seizure.	ANALYSIS
In such premises I hold that the prosecution failed to prove the factum of seizure from the possession of the accused for want of independent corroboration.	ANALYSIS
Hence the prosecution failed to establish the seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.	ANALYSIS
 8.  With regard to nature of seized article whether it is liquor or not.	ANALYSIS
 P.W. 2 stated that the seized article is I.D. liquor.	ANALYSIS
No document is filed or proved on behalf of prosecution to establish that P.W. 2 is competent enough to opine on the subject of liquor, spirit or intoxicant being an expert U/s. 45 of Indian Evidence Act.	ANALYSIS
No distillery training certificate has been filed on his behalf.	ANALYSIS
Further this witness has admittedly stated in cross- examination that he had not sent the seized article or samples for chemical examination which is one of the surest test.	ANALYSIS
Hence, I hold that prosecution failed to establish that the seized article is I.D. liquor.	RATIO
 9.       In view of the whole discussions in foregoing paragraphs, since the prosecution failed to establish that the seizure is from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused, I hold that prosecution failed to establish the charge leveled against the accused person for commission of offence U/s.47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act beyond all reasonable doubt.	RATIO
Hence, I acquit him therefrom under the provisions of Sec.248(1) Cr.P.C.	RPC
He be set at liberty and discharged from his bail bond.	RPC
Enter the case as mistake of fact.	RPC
 The seized liquor kept at Excise Malkhana, be destroyed after four months expiry of appeal period, if no appeal is preferred and in case of appeal subject to the orders of the appellate court.
