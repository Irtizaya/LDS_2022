The accused person namely Munia Puran stands charged for the commission of offence u/s. 47 (a) of the Bihar & Orissa Excise Act.	FAC
The accused is on bail and is absent in the Court today.	FAC
2. Briefly stated, the case of the prosecution is that on 09.12.2001 at about 12.30 PM in Turiberna area while Md. Zamir Hussain, S.I. Of Excise, Panposh, Rourkela was performing patrolling duty along with other official staffs, they conducted raid in the house of the accused and recovered one plastic jerrycane containing 10 litres of country made mahua liquor.	FAC
After that S.I. Of Excise conducted smell test, tongue test, blue litmus paper test, hydrometer test.	FAC
By conducting hydrometer test, the temperature was found to be 720 F, indication to be 82.6 and strength to be 52.20 UP.	FAC
Out of his distillery training and experience ascertained that the liquid was nothing but I.D liquor.	FAC
On being asked, the accused could not produce any licence or authority with respect to same.	FAC
After measurement through litre measure, the whole quantity was found to be 10 litres.	FAC
Seizure was effected and then seizure list was prepared.	FAC
The S.I of Excise, arrested the accused and forwarded her to the court.	FAC
After completion of inquiry, he submitted P.R.against the accused u/s. 47 (a) of the B & O Excise Act to face her trial .	FAC
Hence, this case.	FAC
3. The Plea of the defence is of outright denial and false implication.	FAC
4. The following points arose for determination in the present case: I.	ISSUE
Whether on 09.12.2001at about 12.30 P.M. at Turiberna area, Munia Puran, the accused, was detected by the Excise officials to be in exclusive and conscious possession of one plastic jerrycane containing 10 litres of I.D liquor without any license or authority?	ISSUE
II. Whether the seized article was nothing but I.D liquor?	ISSUE
5. In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined 2 witnesses in all out of whom P.W. 1 is the independent witness to the seizure and Ext. 2 is the Excise constable.	FAC
Rest one witness has been declined by the learned A.P.P. Ext.s 1 and 1/1 are marked on behalf of the prosecution.	FAC
On the other hand, defence has neither examined any witnesses nor marked any documents as exhibits on its behalf.	FAC
6. The learned defence counsel has argued that the case is falsely foisted against the accused and no such occurrence took place to which the learned APP vehemently objected.	ARG_RESPONDENT
7. On appreciation of evidence on record P.W.2, the Excise Constable has deposed that on 09.12.2001 he was performing patrolling duty at Turiberna area along with his official staffs.	FAC
During patrolling duty they detected one person with a plastic jerrycane which contained 10 litres of I.D liquor.	FAC
The seizure list has been admitted into evidence vide Ext.1 and his signature as Ext.1/1.	FAC
The independent witness examined in this case has deposed that he does not know anything about the present case and further stated that nothing was seized in his presence.	FAC
8. The next question to be determined is whether the seizure was made from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.	ANALYSIS
To this the learned counsel for the accused submitted that the independent witness available in this case did not prove the search and seizure.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The seized article was also not produced before the Court during the course of trial.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The witness examined in this case is the interested witness for the prosecution as such he cannot be relied upon and accordingly, the accused be acquitted.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Admittedly, the seized liquor has not been produced in the court.	ANALYSIS
The witness examined is the interested witness whose evidence required corroboration by independent witness which is absent in this case.	ANALYSIS
In the absence of independent corroboration, the search and seizure of the contraband articles become doubtful.	ANALYSIS
No documents relating to the ownership of the house were verified from the accused.	ANALYSIS
The possibility that her husband and other inmates might have possessed the same can not be ruled out in the facts of this case.	ANALYSIS
When the evidence on this score is wanting, the criminal liability for the existence of the liquor can not be fastened on the accused beyond doubt.	ANALYSIS
There is totally absence of evidence regarding the conscious possession of the I.D. Liquor by the accused.	ANALYSIS
In view of the above discussion, the fact that the seized article was recovered from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused becomes doubtful.	RATIO
Hence, it is concluded that prosecution has failed to prove the factum of seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts.	RATIO
 9.  In the result, therefore, I hold the accused not guilty of committing the offence punishable U/s. 47(a) of the Bihar & Orissa Excise Act and acquit her as per S. 248(1) of the Cr.PC.	RPC
The accused be set at liberty forthwith and is discharged from her bail bond.	RPC
 The seized articles, if any, be destroyed after four months of expiry of appeal period if no appeal is preferred and if preferred, be dealt with as per the direction of the Appellate Court.	RPC
Enter this case as mistake of fact.	RPC
Pronounced the judgment in the Open Court today i.e on 22nd day of June, 2015 under my hand and seal of the Court.	NONE
