####ANALYSIS####
An inherent power is not an omnibus for opening a Pandora's box, that too for issues that are foreign to the main context.The invoking of the power has to be for a purpose that is connected to a proceeding and not for sprouting an altogether new issue.A power cannot exceed its own authority beyond its own creation.It is not that a person is remediless.On the contrary, the constitutional remedy of writs is available.Here, the High Court enjoys wide powers of prerogative writs as compared to that under Section 482 CrPC.To secure the corpus of an individual, remedy by way of habeas corpus is available.For that the High Court should not resort to inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC as the legislature has conferred separate powers for the same.Needless to mention that Section 97 CrPC empowers the Magistrates to order the search of a person wrongfully confined.It is something different that the same court exercising authority can, in relation to the same subject-matter, invoke its writ jurisdiction as well.Nevertheless, the inherent powers are not to provide universal remedies.The power cannot be and should not be used to belittle its own existence.One cannot concede anarchy to an inherent power for that was never the wisdom of the legislature.To confer unbridled inherent power would itself be trenching upon the authority of the legislature."

Whether justified.

Exercise of.

HEADNOTE:
         The appellants were prosecuted under s. 341 Indian

Penal Code and under s.36AD of the Banking Regulation Act
1949, on a complaint filed by the Operation Manager of the
respondent-Bank in the Court of the Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate.It was alleged that the appellants had without
reasonable cause obstructed the officers of the Bank from
lawfully entering the premises of the branch of the Bank and
had obstructed the transactions of normal business.After
trial the appellants were acquitted.The respondent-Bank filed an appeal against the
judgment of acquittal before the High Court, which was
disposed of after nearly six years.The High Court set said
the judgment of acquittal and remanded the case for retrial
for offences punishable under s. 341 read with s.34 or s.
149 Indian Penal Code.

         The appellants appealed to this Court against the
judgment of the High Court ordering re-trial.

         Allowing the appeal,
^

         HELD: 1.The judgment of the High Court is set aside
and the order of acquittal passed by the Metropolitan
Magistrate is restored without expressing any opinion on the
issues of fact and law.[821 F]

         2.Whatever might have been the error committed by the
Magistrate, it Was not just proper for the High Court to
have remanded the case for fresh trial, when the order of
the acquittal had been nearly six years before the judgment
of the High Court.[820 D-E]
         3.The pendency of the Criminal Appeal for six years
before the High Court is itself a regrettable feature of

this case.The order directing re-trial has resulted in
serious prejudice to the appellants.Having regard to the
nature of the acts alleged to have been committed by the
appellants this was a case in which the High Court should
have directed the dropping of the proceedings in exercise of
its inherent powers under s.482 Criminal Procedure Code even
if it came to the conclusion that the acquittal was wrong.A
fresh trial nearly seven years after the alleged incident is
bound to result in harassment and abuse of judicial process.[820 E-G]

         CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Criminal Appeal No.848 of 1985.From the Judgment and Order dated 19.12.1984 of the Calcutta High Court in Crl. A. No. 315 of 1978.
         D.N. Mukharjee and P.K. Chakravorty for the Appellants.
         U.R. Lalit, V.N. Koura and Ashok Grover for the Respondent.
         The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH, J.

....420, 422....
####RLC####
The High Court felt that the trial court had missed the essence of the offences with which the appellants had been charged and therefore there was failure of justice.Hence it set aside the judgment of acquittal passed by the Magistrate and remanded the case for retrial for offences punishable under section 341 read with section 34 or section 149, Indian Penal Code.

....422, 423....
####FAC####
Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the appellants have filed this appeal.

....423, 428....
####ANALYSIS####
After going through the judgment of the Magistrate and of the High Court we feel that whatever might have been the error committed by the Magistrate, in the circumstances of the case, it was not just and proper for the High Court to have remanded the case for fresh trial, when the order of acquittal had been passed nearly six years before the judgment of High Court.The pendency of the Criminal Appeal for six years before the High Court is itself a regrettable feature of this case.In addition to it, the order directing retrial has resulted in serious prejudice to the appellants.
We are of the view that having regard to the nature of the acts alleged to have been committed by the appellants and other attendant circumstances, this was a case in which the High Court should have directed the dropping of the proceedings in exercise of its inherent powers under section 482, Criminal Procedure Code even if for some reason on it came to the conclusion that the acquittal was wrong.A fresh trial nearly seven years after the alleged incident is bound to result in harassment and abuse of judicial process.

....435, 438....
####RPC####
We accordingly set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the order of acquittal passed in this case by the Metropolitan Magistrate without however expressing any opinion on the issues of facts and law involved in the case.
 The appeal is accordingly allowed. Appeal allowed.
