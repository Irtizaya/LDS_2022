The statement recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C, which is relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner is placed before me.	ANALYSIS

ANALYSIS
When the victim entered into 10th standard, started touching, pulling and pushing despite resistance and for the last question when it was asked as to why the statement was given, the victim says to dismiss the case.	ANALYSIS

 10. It is this answer of the victim girl, learned counsel for the petitioner submits as a changed circumstance that entitles the petitioner-accused for anticipatory bail.	ANALYSIS
