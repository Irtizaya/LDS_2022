        THIS RPFC IS FILED U/S 19(4) OF THE FC ACT,
AGAINST THE JUDGEMENT DATED 24.07.2014, PASSED IN
CRL.MISC. NO. 89/2013 BY THE PRL.JUDGE, FAIMLY COURT
AT RAICHUR, PARTLY ALLOWING THE PETITION FILED BY
THE PETITIONER U/S 125 OF CR.P.C.

        THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ADMISSION THIS
DAY, THE COURT PASSED THE FOLLOWING:

                                    ORDER	PREAMBLE

 The petitioner  husband has preferred this Revision Petition challenging the order passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Raichur in Crl. Misc. Case No.89/2013 u/s.125 of Cr.P.C. granting maintenance at the rate of Rs.4,000/- per month to the respondent  wife from the date of petition.	RLC
2. I have heard the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel for the respondent.	NONE

 3. The petitioner herein is the husband and respondent herein is the wife and their marriage solemnized on 24.5.2002 at Aarya Samaj Raichur as per the customs in their community.	FAC
After the marriage, the respondent joined the petitioner and led married life for quite some time.	FAC

Thereafter, the petitioner  husband has neglected and refused to maintain the respondent  wife and due to the ill- treatment and harassment by him, the respondent sheltered herself in her parental house and she made a request to the petitioner to maintain her or to pay her maintenance.	FAC
But he has not made any arrangements to maintain her.	FAC
Therefore, it led to filing of the petition u/s.125 of Cr.P.C.	FAC

 4. It is contended by the learned counsel for the respondent that petitioner is working in a reputed Towel Company and getting monthly income of Rs.30,000/- apart from getting agricultural income.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The respondent has no means to maintain herself.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Therefore, she need Rs.6,000/- per month for her day today necessities.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The petitioner appeared before the Court and he contested the proceedings.	FAC

He has taken up the contention throughout that he has been ready and willing to join the company of the respondent and to lead a happy married life.	ARG_PETITIONER
But the wife herself has deserted the company of the petitioner and she left the matrimonial home without any justifiable reasons.	ARG_PETITIONER
She has also taken away all gold and other articles given to her at the time of marriage.	ARG_PETITIONER
Further, he has taken up the contention that he is attending only to some private work and earning Rs.150/- per day.	ARG_PETITIONER
On the other hand, the wife knows tailoring and she is earning Rs.200/- per day and therefore, she is able to maintain herself.	ARG_PETITIONER
The parties have examined themselves before the Court as PW1 and RW1 respectively and petitioner got marked Ex.P1 to P3 documents.	FAC

 5. After hearing both the parties, the learned Principal Judge of the Family Court is of the opinion that the wife is entitled for Rs.4,000/- per month towards maintenance.	RLC
The relationship between the parties being admitted and the Court has observed that though the wife has stated that her husband has been earning Rs.30,000/-per month, but she has not produced any material.	RLC
Likewise, though the husband has taken up the contention that his wife is doing tailoring work and earning Rs.200/- per day, he has also not produced any material.	RLC
It is an admitted fact that both of them are not living together.	FAC
The wife is residing in her parental house, due to the relationship being strained.	FAC

 6. Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case, the Trial Court has observed that in the absence of any material to show the income of the husband, it is quite natural to hold that atleast the wife requires Rs.4,000/- per month for the purpose of day to day expenditure for maintenance and also for clothing, medicines etc.,	RLC
Therefore, the Trial Court awarded Rs.4,000/- per month.	RLC
The husband has taken up a very casual defence that he is ready and willing to take her back, but it appears, he has not made any efforts in this regard.	ANALYSIS
On the other hand, he has admitted that his wife is living in her parental house.	ANALYSIS
There is no material to show that after his wife started living in her parental house, he has not made any arrangements to maintain her or at any point of time he has not made any efforts to join her during the pendency of the proceedings or prior to the filing of the petition.	ANALYSIS
That itself is sufficient to hold that he has neglected and refused to maintain her.	ANALYSIS

 7. So far as the quantum of award is concerned, both the parties have not produced any materials on record.	ANALYSIS
The Court has analysed that the husband is hale and healthy person and he has got capacity to earn.	ANALYSIS
On the other hand, though the wife is separately living, no material is placed to show that she has got knowledge of tailoring and actually she has been doing the tailoring work and earning.	ANALYSIS
8. In the above said circumstances, awarding of maintenance at the rate of Rs.4,000/- per month, in my opinion, cannot be called as an exorbitant amount.	ANALYSIS
However, it is made it clear that if the husband or the wife would get any amount more in the changed circumstances, they can approach once again the Trial Court either for enhancement or for reduction of the amount.	ANALYSIS
9. Before parting with this order, the learned counsel for the petitioner brought to the notice of this Court that the wife has also filed another petition before the Principal Civil Judge & JMFC, Raichur in Crl. Misc. No.218/2013 under the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, claiming maintenance.	ANALYSIS
The order of the said Court dated 7.5.2014 reveals that an interim maintenance of Rs.2,000/- per month has already been granted by the Court.	ANALYSIS
The learned counsel for the petitioner submit before the Court that subsequently the said case in Crl.Mis No.218/2013 on the file of the Principal Civil Judge & JMFC, Raichur was disposed of granting maintenance of Rs.2,000/- per month and also awarding of Rs.3,000/- per month towards house rent.	ANALYSIS
Therefore, in all, the husband is liable to pay an amount of Rs.5,000/- in Crl. Misc. No.218/2013 and Rs.4,000/- by virtue of the order of the Family Court.	ANALYSIS

 10. It is not made it clear before this Court as to whether the proceedings in the Prl. Civil Judge & JMFC, Raichur was brought to the notice of the Family Court or the proceedings of the Family Court was brought to the notice of the Trial Court and inspite of that whether such orders have been passed or not.	ANALYSIS
Therefore, in my opinion, when the orders of the Principal Civil Judge & JMFC, Raichur is not questioned before this Court, no order can be passed so far as granting of maintenance and rentals passed by the said Court.	ANALYSIS

However, it is made it clear that if both the orders are allowed to run together, it will cause inconvenience and injustice to the husband.	ANALYSIS
Therefore, narrating all the above said factual aspects if the petitioner is aggrieved by the order of the Principal Civil Judge & JMFC, who has passed the order without taking into consideration the order passed by the Family Court, he is at liberty to make necessary application for cancellation of the said order or for modification of the said order or if the petition has already disposed of on merits, he is at liberty to prefer an appeal against the said order before the competent Court.	ANALYSIS
In such eventuality, the competent Court shall take into consideration the order passed by the Family Court in awarding maintenance at the rate of Rs.4,000/- per month.	ANALYSIS
Therefore, with this observation, this Court cannot reduce the amount of Rs.4,000/- granted by the Family Court.	RATIO
Therefore, the order passed by the Family Court deserves to be confirmed.	RPC
11. Further, it is made it clear that either for enhancement of the maintenance or for reduction of the maintenance granted by the Family Court or by the Principal Civil Judge & JMFC, Raichur, the parties are at liberty to make necessary application u/s.125(3) of Cr.P.C. for modification of the order in view of the above circumstances.	RPC

 With this observation, the Revision Petition is dismissed.	RPC
