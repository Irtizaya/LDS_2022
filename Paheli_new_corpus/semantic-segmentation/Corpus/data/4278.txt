This Income Tax Appeal filed by the Appellant- Revenue earlier came to be disposed of by a co-ordinate Bench of this Court on 03.11.2011, on the ground that the appeal was not maintainable due to the tax effect involved being less than the prescribed monetary limit of Rs.20 lakhs in the Instructions issued by Central Board of Direct Taxes in 2011 (for short the `CBDT').

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.R.M.B.Dairy Farming (P.) Ltd. (supra) held as under:- "Appeal to High Court  Monetary limits for litigation by Department  Circular to apply to pending appeals  but Circular not to be applied by court ipso facto when matter has cascading effect or where common principles involved in large number of matters Income Tax Act, 1961 ss. 260A, 268A  Instruction No.3 of 2011, dated 9-2-2011.
 The view adopted by the Delhi High Court making the circular applicable to pending matters came up before a three- Judges Bench of this Court in SLP (C) No.CC 13694 of 2011 titled CIT v. Surya Herbal Ltd. when the following order was passed on August 29, 2011: "Delay condoned.

Liberty is given to the Department to move the High Court pointing out that the Circular dated February 9, 2011 should not be applied ipso facto, particularly, when the matter has a cascading effect.	PRE_RELIED
There are cases under the Income-tax Act, 1961 in which a common principle may be involved in subsequent group of matters or a large number of matters.	PRE_RELIED
In our view, in such cases if attention of the High Court is drawn, the High Court will not apply the circular ipso facto.	PRE_RELIED
For that purpose, liberty is granted to the Department to move the High Court in two weeks.	PRE_RELIED

6/22 Circular dated February 9, 2011 was not interfered with, but with two caveats  (i) Circular should not be applied by the High Courts ipso facto when the matter had a cascading effect; (ii) where common principles may be involved in subsequent group of matters or a large number of matters.
It was opined that in such cases, the attention of the High Court would be drawn and the Department was even given liberty to move the High Court in two weeks.	ANALYSIS
In our view this order holds the field and should continue to hold the field.	ANALYSIS

 21. Unfortunately, this order was not brought to the notice of the subsequent two Judges Bench of this court in CIT v. Suman Dhamija again arising from a Delhi High Court order, wherein it was simply stated that since the appeals were preferred before 2011 and the instructions were dated February 9, 2011, the earlier cases would not The Commissioner of Income-Tax & Anr.

This order in turn had been followed by another two- Judges Bench in Civil Appeal No.16815 of 2017 titled CIT v. Gemini Distilleries dated October 12, 2017.	ANALYSIS

 22. Once again, in another matter CIT v.
Century Park, the line adopted by the three- Judges Bench in Surya Herbal Ltd. Case (supra) has been followed.	ANALYSIS

 23. We have already given our imprimatur to the observations made by the Karnataka High Court in a detailed analysis in Ranka and Ranka case (supra), which was dealt with the litigation policy philosophy behind applying the circular and the benefit being extended in view thereof to all assesses where appeals have been pending, but below the financial limit, as otherwise an anomalous situation would arise.

 24. We may also take note of the judgment of this court in Suchitra Components Ltd.
v. CCE on the general principle of application of circulars.	PRE_RELIED
Reliance was placed on the view expressed in CCE v. Mysore Electricals Industries Ltd. opining that a beneficial circular has to be applied retrospectively while an oppressive circular has to be applied prospectively.	PRE_RELIED

 25. We are of the view that the mater needs to be put to rest and a clarity be obtained in view of the impact of this issue on pending cases before the High Courts as well as the cases which have been disposed of by various High Courts by applying Circular of 2011 to pending litigations.	ANALYSIS
In our view the matter has been squarely put to rest taking further care of the interest of the Revenue by the order passed by the three-Judges Bench of this court in Surya Herbal Ltd. Case (supra), which had put two caveats even to The Commissioner of Income-Tax & Anr.
                                                                                                                                   vs.
 M/s.Luwa India Pvt. Ltd.
 9/22 the retrospective application of the circular.
        	ANALYSIS
The subsequent orders have been passed by the two-Judges Bench without those orders being brought to the notice of the court, a duty which was cast on the Department to have done so to avoid the ambiguity which has arisen.	ANALYSIS
Thus, the said view of the three- Judges Bench would hold water and the circular would apply even to pending matters but subject to the two caveats provided in Surya Herbal Ltd. Case (supra).
 	ANALYSIS
The appeals of the Revenue are, thus, dismissed in the aforesaid terms."	ANALYSIS

 3. Recently, the CBDT has again revised the Instructions in this regard and besides para 13 specifically allowing withdrawal of pending appeals, the monetary limits for maintaining such Income Tax appeals before the High Court is raised from The Commissioner of Income-Tax & Anr.

In the past, a number of instances have come to the notice of the Board, whereby an assessee has claimed relief from the Tribunal or the Court only on the ground that the Department has implicitly accepted the decision of the Tribunal or Court in the case of the assessee for any other assessment year or in the case of any other assessee for the same or any other assessment year, by not filing an appeal on the same disputed issues.	ANALYSIS
The Departmental representatives/counsels must make every effort to bring to the notice of the Tribunal or the Court that the appeal in such cases was not filed or not admitted only for the reason of the tax effect being less than the specified monetary limit and, therefore, no inference should be drawn that the decisions rendered therein were acceptable to the Department.
