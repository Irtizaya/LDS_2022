In view of these witnesses, prosecution has declined to examine the rest of the witnesses named in the charge sheet.	ANALYSIS
On other hand, the accused has preferred not to adduce any evidence in his defence.	ANALYSIS
6.  In order to avoid repetition and for the sake of brevity and precision , this Court feels it appropriate to consider the merit of the prosecution case as a whole in respect of all offence alleged against the accused instead of analysing each offence individually .	ANALYSIS
Proceeding in that direction , the informant while being examined as P.W.3 has deposed that on 25.07.2004 at about 3.00 PM to 4.00 PM his grand son Deepak Kumar Patel had come to his house from Ujjalpur in a Hero Honda splendor motor cycle bearing Regd NO. OR 16 9395 and while he was returning through Mahuljor forest are , another motor cycle bearing Regd No. OR 14G 6618 coming from the opposite direction in high speed dashed with him , as a result of which , his grand son fell down and received bleeding injuries in his head an died on the spot.	ANALYSIS
The informant has fairly deposed in the Court , he does not know the accused.	ANALYSIS
He has identified the FIR lodged by him Ext.3 and his signature thereon as Ext.3/1.	ANALYSIS
Similarly he deposed that the police conducted inquest over the dead body of the grand son and prepared inquest report which has been marked as Ext.4.	ANALYSIS
The independent witnesses (P.W.4, P.W.5 and P.W.8) have also deposed in the same light as that of P.W.3.	ANALYSIS
P.W.6 has deposed that the deceased is his nephew and on the fateful day, the deceased had taken his motor cycle bearing Regd No. OR 16 9395 and during course of investigation, the police handed over the said motor cycle to him by executing a zimanama (Ext.6).	ANALYSIS
P.W.7 has merely deposed that on 25.07.2004 there was an accident of two motor cycles and two persons were injured .	ANALYSIS
He has expressed his inability to depose anything more regarding the case.	ANALYSIS
P.W.9 has stated that during course of investigation of the case , the police had handed over the Hero Honda splendor motor cycle bearing Regd No. OR 14G 6618 and its documents to him by executing a zimanama (Ext.7).	ANALYSIS
P.W.1 is a medical officer who had examined the accused facing trial in this case.	ANALYSIS
After the alleged occurrence.	ANALYSIS
P.W.2 is the medical officer who had conducted post mortem examination of the deceased and has deposed the cause of death to be shock and hemorrhage due to injury to vital organ like brain.	ANALYSIS
The investigating officer who has been examined as P.W.10 has deposed that after taking the charge of the investigation of the case, he visited the spot, prepared th spot map (Ext.8), conducted inquest of the dead body of the deceased and prepared inquest report vide Ext.5, sent the dead body for post mortem examination, seized both the motor cycles bearing Regd No. OR 16 9395 and OR 14G 6618 vide seizure lists marked as Ext.4 and Ext.10 respectively, handed over the same in zima by executing zimanama marked as Ext.6 and Ext.7 , obtained MVI report and on completion of investigation submitted charge sheet against the accused.	ANALYSIS
So far as the offence u/s 279/337/304(A) of IPC is concerned , the crux of the offence lies in prosecution establishing rash or negligent act on the part of the accused.	ANALYSIS
As regards the case in hand, though it is apparent from the evidence of the informant and other witnesses that there was a collision between the motor cycles one out of which bearing Regd No. OR 16 9395 was being driven by the deceased and has result of such head to head collision, the grand son of the informant died on the spot but there is nothing in the evidence to reveal that such occurrence happened due to rash and negligent act on the part of the accused.	ANALYSIS
More over, though the investigating officer has deposed that he had obtained MVI report during course of investigation but there is no clear evidence from the side of prosecution to reveal as to in respect of which of the two motor cycles the MVI report was obtained.	ANALYSIS
Even such MVI report has not been proved in this court so as to lend any assistant to the case of prosecution against the accused.	ANALYSIS
Though it is well established from evidence adduced from the side of prosecution that the deceased died in a vehiclular accident having sustained injuries in vital organ like brain but there is absolutely no evidence to establish that the accused was responsible for such occurrence and death of the deceased by doing any rash or negligent act on his part.	ANALYSIS
So far as the offence u/s 181 of the MV Act is concerned, there is no iota of evidence from the side of prosecution that the accused was driving any vehicle in contravention of Sec. 3 or Sec. 4 of the MV Act.	ANALYSIS
The evidence of the IO is completely silent in that regard.	ANALYSIS
In view of the above discussion, this Court finds lack of evidence to bring home the charges levelled against the accused.	RATIO

 7.       In the result I hold the accused not guilty of offence u/s 279/337/304(A) of IPC and he be acquitted therefrom as per the provision of section 255(1) of Cr.P.C.	RPC
The accused be set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case .	RPC
The zimanama be cancelled and the seized articles be handed over to its rightful owner after four months of expiry of the appeal period in case of no appeal and in case of any appeal as per the order of the Appellate Court.	RPC
Enter this case as mistake of fact for statistical purpose .	RPC
