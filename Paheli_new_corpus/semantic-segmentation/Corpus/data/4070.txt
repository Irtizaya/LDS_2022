HEADNOTE:
%

         Sub-section (2) of s. 9 of the Central Sales Tax Act,
1956 makes the assessment procedure prescribed under the
general sales tax law of the appropriate State applicable to
the assessment to be made under the Central Act.	PREAMBLE
Section 13
of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 requires
the dealer to submit returns in such manner, within such
period and to such authority as may be prescribed. Sub-
	PREAMBLE
section (1) of s. 14 permits the assessing authority to
assess the amount of tax due on the returns submitted under
s. 13 only within a period of four years from the expiry of
the year to which the assessment relates.	PREAMBLE
Sub-section (3)
permits the assessing authority to make best judgment
assessment where a dealer (i) fails to submit return before
the date prescribed; (ii) produces the accounts registers
and other documents after inspection and (iii) submits a
return subsequent to the date of inspection, within a period
of six years from the expiry of the year	PREAMBLE
to which the
assessment relates.	PREAMBLE


         In the main appeal before this Court the assessee-
respondent filed its return relating to the quarter ending
31st March, 1969 on 7th August, 1969 under the Central Sales
Tax Act.	PREAMBLE
The last date prescribed by law was 24th May, 1969.	PREAMBLE
The Commercial Tax officer passed the assessment order on
3rd August, 1973, beyond four years from 31st March, 1969,
the last day of the assessment year 1968-69.	PREAMBLE
The assessee's
appeals against that order were dismissed by the Assistant
Commissioner and the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal.	PREAMBLE
The High
Court in revision, however, held that the assessment made
after four years from the last day of the assessment year
was not a valid assessment.	PREAMBLE

         In the connected appeal the respondent who was the

assessee filed the annual return in respect of the
assessment year 1968-69 under the A provisions of the
Central Act on 19th August, 1969 after the expiry of the
prescribed date.	PREAMBLE
The order of assessment was passed on 2nd
August, 1973 beyond four years from the last day of the
assessment year 196869.	PREAMBLE
An appeal against that order was
dismissed by the Assistant Commissioner.	PREAMBLE
The Sales Tax
Appellate Tribunal, however, allowed the appeal holding that
the assessment had been passed beyond four years from the
last day of the assessment year.	PREAMBLE
The revision petition
preferred by the State was dismissed in limine by the High
Court.	PREAMBLE


         In the appeals by special leave filed by the State, it
was contended for the respondent that since the returns in
the cases had been accepted, even though they had filed been
beyond the prescribed date, the assessments made thereon
could not be considered as best judgment assessments and,
therefore, sub-section (3) of s. 14 of the Act under which
it is permissible to make best judgment assessments would be
inapplicable.

         Allowing the appeals.	PREAMBLE

         	PREAMBLE
HELD: 1.1 on a true construction of sub-s. (1) and sub-
s. (3) of s. 14 of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act,
1957 it is apparent that where a return is not filed by a
dealer before the date prescribed in that behalf under the
Act the assessing authority has jurisdiction to complete the
assessment within a period of six years from the expiry of
the year to which the assessment relates.	PREAMBLE
[744C]

         1.2	PREAMBLE
The two types of cases which fall under sub-s. (1)
and sub-s. (3) of s. 14 of the Act respectively are mutually
exclusive.	PREAMBLE
The return on the basis of which an assessment is
to be made under s. 14(1) is a return filed within the
prescribed period and in such a case the assessment has to
be completed within a period of four years from the expiry
of the period to which the assessment relates.	PREAMBLE
The Act
confers a distinct advantage on such a dealer who is prompt
in filing his return inasmuch as he acquires immunity
against assessment on the expiry of the said period of four
years.	PREAMBLE
All cases where the return is submitted beyond the
prescribed date fall under sub-s. (3) of s. 14 of the Act.	PREAMBLE

Assessment in such cases may be completed within six years
from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.	PREAMBLE

When once it is established in a case that a return has not
been filed within the prescribed period such case falls
outside s. 14(1) of the Act and therefore the period of four
years prescribed therein becomes automatically inapplicable.
It clearly falls under cl. (i) of sub-s. (3) of s. 14 of the
Act and assessment can be H
         made in such a case within the expiry of the period of
six years.	PREAMBLE
In the instant cases the returns were not filed
within the prescribed dates.	PREAMBLE
The assessments have,
therefore, been rightly made within six years from the
	PREAMBLE
expiry	PREAMBLE
of the year to which the assessments relate	PREAMBLE
. [742G-H;
743A-B; 744C]

         2. Whether the assessment made is the best judgment or
not has no bearing at all on the period within which an
assessment can be made under the Act.	PREAMBLE
It depends upon the
other conditions mentioned in sub-s. (1) and (3) of s. 14.	PREAMBLE
Best judgment assessment can be made even in a case falling
under sub-s. (1), as is evident from the latter part of that
sub-section which reads: "but if the return appears to him

to be incorrect or incomplete he shall after giving the
dealer a reasonable opportunity of proving the correctness
and completeness of the return submitted by him and making
such inquiry as he deems necessary, to assess to the best of
his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer." Yet
such best judgment assessment has to be completed within a
period of four years from the expiry of the year to which
the assessment relates.	PREAMBLE
Therefore, in the instant case
merely because the assessments are not best judgment
assessments, it cannot be said that sub-s. (3) of s. 14 is
inapplicable.	PREAMBLE
Neither the High Court nor the Tribunal gave
adequate attention to the words 'before the date prescribed
in that behalf' in cl. (i) of sub-s. (3) of s. 14.	PREAMBLE
They laid
emphasis only on the words 'fails to submit return' in the
said sub-clause to arrive at a wrong conclusion.	PREAMBLE

That Revision Petition was dismissed in limine by the High Court.	FAC
Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court the State of Andhra Pradesh has filed this appeal by special leave.	FAC

 The only question which arises for consideration in these appeals is whether the orders of assessment in the above two cases which had admittedly been passed beyond four years from the last day of the assessment year but within the period of six years from that date had been validly passed.	ISSUE
By virtue of section 9 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 the procedure prescribed for making an assessment under the Act is applicable to the assessments to be made under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.	ANALYSIS
Section 13 of the Act prescribes that every dealer who is liable to get himself registered under section 12 or section 12-A as the case may be under the Act shall submit such return or returns relating to his turnover in such manner within such period and to such authority as may be prescribed.	STA
The material part of section 14 which is relevant for purposes of these cases reads thus: "14. Assessment of tax: ( I) If the assessing authority is satisfied that any return submitted under section 13 is correct and complete, he shall assess the amount of tax payable by the dealer on the basis thereof, but if the return appears to him to be incorrect or incomplete he shall, after giving the dealer a reasonable opportunity of proving the correctness and completeness of the return submitted by him and making such inquiry as he deems necessary, assess to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer.
                  	STA
An assessment under this section shall be made only within a period of four years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.	STA

                                         ...................	STA

 (3) Where any dealer liable to tax under this Act- (i) fails to submit return before the date prescribed in that behalf, or (ii) produces the accounts, registered and other documents after inspection, or (iii) submits a return subsequent to the date of inspection, the assessing authority may, at any time within a period of six years from the expiry of the year to which assessment relates, after issuing a notice to the dealer and after such enquiry as he considers necessary, assess to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer on his turnover for that year, and may direct the dealer to pay in addition to the tax so assessed penalty as specified in subsection (8)."
         	STA
It is necessary to analyse sub-section (1) and sub- section (3) of section 14 of the Act for purposes of determining the issue involved in these cases.	ANALYSIS
Sub-section ( ]) of section 14 of the Act provides that if the assessing authority is satisfied that any return submitted under section 13 is correct and complete, he shall assess the amount of tax payable by the dealer on the basis thereof but if the return appears to the assessing authority to be incorrect or incomplete he shall after giving the dealer reasonable opportunity of proving the correctness and completeness of the return submitted and making such inquiry as he deems necessary, assess to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer.	STA
In both these cases the return contemplated is one which has been filed in accordance with section 13 of the Act within the time prescribed for that purpose.	ANALYSIS
Such an assessment under sub- section ( 1) of section 14 of the Act can be made within a period of four years from the expiry of the period to which the assessment relates.	ANALYSIS
Sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act authorises the assessing authority to make an assessment to the best of his judgment in three cases: (i) where a dealer under the Act fails to submit return before the date prescribed in that behalf, (ii) where a dealer produces the accounts. registers and other documents after inspection and (iii) where a dealer submits a return subsequent to the date of inspection.	STA
In these three cases theassessing authority is empowered to make an assessment to the best of '4 his judgment at any time within a period of six years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates after issuing a notice to the dealer and after such inquiry which he considers necessary to make the assessment.	ANALYSIS

         The crucial question which arises for consideration in these cases is whether in a case where the assessee submits a true and complete return after the prescribed date the assessment should be completed within a period of four years prescribed by sub-section ( 1) of section 14 of the Act or within a period of six years permitted under sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act.	ANALYSIS
Sub-section (1) of section 14 of the Act relates to an assessment which may be made on the basis of a return submitted under section 13 of the Act.	ANALYSIS
Section 13 of the Act as stated above provides that every dealer shall submit such return or returns relating to his turnover in such manner within such period and to such authority as may be prescribed.	STA
The return on the basis of which an assessment is to be made under section 14(1) of the Act is, therefore, a return filed within the prescribed period and in such a case the assessment has to be completed within a period of four years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.	ANALYSIS
The return referred to in sub- section ( 1) of section 14 of the Act cannot be a return filed beyond the prescribed date is emphasised by clause (i) of sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act which refers to a case where a dealer liable to pay tax fails to submit return before the date prescribed in that behalf.	ANALYSIS
All cases where the return is submitted beyond the prescribed date fall under sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act.	ANALYSIS

 The scheme of the Act regarding the period within which assessments can be made is very simple.	ANALYSIS
Assessments in cases falling under sub-section (1) of section 14 of the Act have to be completed within four years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates and assessments in cases falling under sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act may be completed within six years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.	ANALYSIS
The two types of cases which fall under sub-section (l) and sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act respectively are mutually exclusive.	ANALYSIS
When once it is established in case that a return has not been filed within the prescribed period such case falls outside section 14 ( l) of the Act and therefore the period of four years prescribed therein becomes automatically inapplicable.	ANALYSIS
It clearly falls under clause (i) of sub- section (3) of section 14 of the Act and assessment can be made in such a case within the expiry of the period of six years.	ANALYSIS
While a dealer who files a return within the prescribedperiod acquires immunity against assessment on the expiry of four years from the last day of the assessment year, a dealer who fails to file a return within the prescribed period has to wait for six years to be over to acquire such immunity.	ANALYSIS
Thus the Act confers a distinct advantage on a dealer who is prompt in filing his return.	ANALYSIS

 We are not impressed by the argument that since the returns in the cases before us had been accepted even though they had been filed beyond the prescribed date the assessments made thereon cannot be considered as best judgment assessment and therefore sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act under which it is permissible to make best judgment assessments would be inapplicable.	ANALYSIS
The period within which assessments can be made under the Act does not depend upon the answer to the question whether the assessment in question is a best judgment assessment or it is an assessment made treating the return as correct and complete but it depends upon the other conditions mentioned in sub-section ( 1) and in sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act.	ANALYSIS
We may here point out that even in a case falling under subsection (1) of section 14 of the Act it is possible for the assessing authority to make a best judgment assessment as can be seen from the latter part of the said sub-section which reads: "but if the return appears to him to be incorrect or incomplete he shall after giving the dealer a reasonable opportunity of proving the correctness and completeness of the return submitted by him and making such inquiry as he deems necessary, assess to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax due from the dealer."	STA
Yet such best judgment assessment has to be completed within a period of four years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.	ANALYSIS
Hence it cannot be held that merely because the assessments in question are not best judgment assessments sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act is inapplicable for best judgment assessments can be made both under sub-section (1) and subsection (3) of section 14 of the Act.	ANALYSIS
That the assessment is a best judgment assessment is not, therefore, decisive of the question involved in these appeals.	ANALYSIS

 The decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the State of Andhra Pradesh v. Pyarelal Malhotra 13 S.T.C. 946 and the decision of this Court in the State of Madras v.
 S.G. Jayaraj Nadar & Sons 28 S.T.C. 700 which dealt with the question as to when a best judgment assessment could be made are not relevant for purposes of deciding the question which has arisen before us.	PRE_NOT_RELIED
As we have already pointed out the question whether the assessment made is the best judgment assessment or not has no bearing at all on the period within which an assess- ment can be made under the Act.	ANALYSIS
Neither in the judgment of the High Court against which Civil Appeal No. 4448 of 1985 is filed nor in the judgment of the Tribunal out of which Civil Appeal No. 694 of 1986 arises adequate attention is given to the words 'before the date prescribed in that behalf in clause (i) of sub-section (3) of section 14 of the Act.	ANALYSIS
The High Court and the Tribunal laid emphasis only on the words "fails to submit return" in the said sub-clause and it is on this account they arrived at a wrong conclusion.	ANALYSIS

 On a true construction of sub-section (I) and sub- section (3) of section 14 of the Act we are of opinion that where a return is not filed by a dealer before the date prescribed in that behalf under the Act, the assessing authority has got jurisdiction to complete the assessment within a period of six years from the expiry of the year to which the assessment relates.	RATIO
Admittedly, in these cases the returns were not filed within the prescribed date and the assessments have been made within six years from the expiry of the year to which the assessments relate.	RATIO
The orders of the High Court against which these appeals have been filed are therefore liable to be set aside.	RPC
In Civil Appeal No.
 4448 or 1985 the judgment of the High Court is set aside and the judgment of the Tribunal is restored.	RPC
In Civil Appeal No. 694 of 1986 the order of the High Court and the judgment of the tribunal are set aside and judgment of the Assistant Commissioner (CT) Appeals, Warangal is restored.	RPC
The respondent shall pay the costs of the Appellant in both the appeals.	RPC

 P.S.S.               Appeals allowed.	RPC
