A complaint came to be lodged by one Sri.Anilkumar before Ranebennur Town Police Station alleging that he had a sister by name Smt.Manjula and she was married to one Sri.Puttanna Ganiger and out of their wedlock, one son and a daughter were born and about 15 years back, his sister Smt.Manjula had expired and as such, he was taking care of the daughter of Smt.Manjula, namely Kum.Vijayalakshmi and she was staying in KLES Hostel, Ranebennur and was visiting their house only during school holidays and festivals.	FAC
It is stated that on 12th December 2015 at about 06.00 p.m., he received a phone call  from  Smt.Leelavati  Fakiragouda Kenchanagoudra, warden of the hostel, stating that from 09.45 a.m., Kum.Vijayalakshmi was not to be seen in the hostel and as such, he went to the Hostel and searched for her and made enquiries with the relatives and suspecting that petitioner had kidnapped her, he sought for suitable action being taken by lodging a complaint, which came to be registered in Crime No.177 of 2015 under Section 363 of the Indian Penal Code.	FAC

 3. It is the contention of Sri.M.H.Patil, learned counsel appearing for petitioner, that a false complaint has been registered against petitioner out of ill-will and now, investigation is concluded and charge-sheet has been filed and as such, petitioner's custodial interrogation would not be required and as such, he seeks for petitioner being enlarged on bail, since he is in custody from 16th December 2015.	ARG_PETITIONER
Petitioner undertakes to abide by any conditions that would be imposed on him.	ARG_PETITIONER

 4.  Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for respondent  State has opposed grant of prayer and by relying upon the charge-sheet material, he would contend that offences alleged against petitioner is under Section 376 of Indian Penal Code and under the provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, which are serious in nature and if petitioner is released on bail, he may tramper with prosecution witnesses and may also abscond from the jurisdiction of the Court.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Hence, he prays for rejection of the petition.	ARG_RESPONDENT

 5.  Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and on perusal of records, it would indicate that warden of the Hostel where victim girl was studying has given a statement to the investigating officer and she has categorically stated that on the date victim girl was absconding, she had found a letter written by her about her intention to commit suicide and as such, she ran away from the hostel.	ANALYSIS
She has also stated that immediately, she had informed the guardian of victim girl namely the complainant about this fact.	ANALYSIS
Statement made under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the victim girl before the jurisdictional Magistrate would also indicate that it was the victim girl who was contacting petitioner over phone quite often and she had eloped with petitioner on 11th December 2015.	ANALYSIS
She has not stated that he had forced her to elope with her.	ANALYSIS

 6. Forensic Science Laboratory report, which was made available by the learned High Court Government Pleader, would indicate that seminal stains were not detected on vaginal swab, perennial swab, pubic hairs, under garments, pubic heirs, swab from penis and under garments.	ANALYSIS

 Likewise, veginal secretions were also not detected on item Nos.7, 8 and 9 i.e., on pubic hairs, swab from penis and under garments, on medical examination by Forensic Science Laboratory experts.	ANALYSIS

 7. Letter written by victim girl produced by the warden of hostel would disclose that she had indicated thereunder that she was going to commit suicide.	RATIO
The contention of Sri.M.H.Patil, learned counsel appearing for petitioner, that when the statement of victim girl made before the jurisdictional Magistrate under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to the effect that she was in love with petitioner and she herself had threatened the petitioner to take her away for getting married, would probabilise the theory of petitioner at this stage.	RATIO
Said contention deserves to be accepted at this stage.	RATIO
In the light of medical evidence available on record, this Court is of the considered view that petitioner is entitled for the relief as sought for.	RATIO

 O R D E R Criminal Petition is hereby allowed.	RPC
