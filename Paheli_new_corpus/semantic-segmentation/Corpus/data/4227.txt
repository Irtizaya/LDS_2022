 2. The story of the prosecution is that: The complainant Sri Sidhakanhu Murmu was working in Bright Security Agency prior to one year of lodging this FIR.	FAC
On 01.10.2018 he was working in S.N Mohanty Nuagaon Crusher Unit.	FAC
On that day at about 2 P.M driver of one dumper bearing No.OR14L 9267 of Maa Santoshi Transport brought iron ore from the crusher unit and parked the vehicle in front of the gate in such a way that no other vehicle could come inside the gate.	FAC
When the complainant asked the driver of the dumper Nidhi Tiria (accused) to remove the vehicle and parked it in a proper way providing space to other vehicles he abused the complaint in obscene language and gave a push pressing his neck.	FAC

    d) Whether the accused persons in furtherance of their common intention committed criminal intimidation by threatening the informant to kill 5.                  him which caused alarm to him and his mind.	ISSUE

    In order to prove its case, Prosecution has examined as many as four witnesses out of which P.W.3 is the complainant of this case and rest are witnesses to the occurrence.	FAC

________ _________________________________________	NONE
______	NONE
___ 11. It is the mandate of law that the facts admitted need not be proved as per Section 58 of the Indian Evidence Act.	ANALYSIS
In the instant case the complainant who is the victim of this case is denying any such assault on him by the accused persons.	ANALYSIS
When the complainant himself is silent regarding the commission of any offence by the accused persons no further discussion is needed to establish the prosecution case.	ANALYSIS

12. On the contrary the I.O in his evidence stated that on 5.10.2008 he was directed to investigate this case and on 29.10.2008 he issued injury requisition for medical examination of the complainant.	ANALYSIS
This is also quite unbelievable.	ANALYSIS
No other prosecution witness is supporting the prosecution case.	ANALYSIS
13. In the end, I am of the considered view that prosecution has failed miserably to prove the offences alleged against the accused persons with beyond all reasonable doubts.	RATIO
14. Considering the above analysis and further considering the above facts and circumstances,it is held that the prosecution has failed to prove the offences u/s. 341/294/323/506/34 of Indian Penal Code against the accused persons beyond all reasonable doubts.	RPC

 In such premises, I hold the accused persons not guilty and acquit them U/s 248(1) of Cr.P.C.	RPC
The accused persons be set at liberty forthwith if not required in any other case and their bail bonds stand cancelled.
 	RPC
Enter this case as a mistake of facts for the statistical purpose.	RPC

      The seized articles if any be destroyed four months after the expiry of the appeal period and in case of appeal the same be disposed as per the order of the Hon'ble Appellate Court.	RPC
Enter this case as a mistake of facts for the statistical purpose.	RPC
