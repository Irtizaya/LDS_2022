ACT:

               Income tax Act (11 of 1922), ss. 2(6A)(e) and
      10(2)(vi-b)--Development rebate treated as accumulated
      profits--Withdrawal of amount by shareholder from Company's
      account--If withdrawal can be treated as dividend since
      amount withdrawn is within accumulated profits.

HEADNOTE:
                       Under s. 2(6A)(e), Income Tax Act, 1922, dividend

              includes any payment by a company, not being a company in
              which the public are substantially interested within the
              meaning of s. 23A, of any sum by way of advance to a share-
              holder to the extent to which the company possesses accumu-
              lated profits.

                       	PREAMBLE
The appellant-assessee was a shareholder in a company
              in which the public were not substantially interested within
              the meaning of s. 23A.	PREAMBLE
He had withdrawn some amounts from
              the company's account.	PREAMBLE
The company had been allowed devel-
              opment rebate under s. 10(2)(vi-b) and that amount was
              debited in the profit and loss account of the company for
              the accounting year leaving a small balance of profit in the
              profit and loss account.	PREAMBLE
The Appellate Assistant Commis-
              	PREAMBLE
sioner treated the entire sum, that is, the amount allowed
              as development rebate and the amount of balance in the
              profit and loss account, as the amount of accumulated prof-
              its possessed by the company.	PREAMBLE
Treating the withdrawals by
              the appellant as advances by the company to him and finding
              the highest amount of advance to the assessee to be within
              the total figure of accumulated profits as arrived at by
              him, he directed the addition of the advance to the asses-
              see's income as dividend under s. 2(6A)(e) of the Act.	PREAMBLE
The
              Tribunal held that the development rebate was not liable to
              be treated as accumulated profits; but, on reference.	PREAMBLE
the
              High Court substantially confirmed the order of the Appel-
              late Assistant Commissioner.	PREAMBLE
On the question whether the development rebate could be
              treated as accumulated profits in the hands of the company
              under s. 2(6A)(e), the appellant contended that the develop-
              ment rebate, being identical with initial depreciation is in
              the nature of depreciation allowance, and since it is de-
              ductible from the assessable profits of the company, it is

also a type of outgoing expenditure or out-of-pocket cost,
and was therefore, deductible from the company's commercial
profits.
Dismissing the appeal,

         HELD:	PREAMBLE
The development rebate reserve created by the
company, although it does not form part of the assessable
profits, undoubtedly forms part of the commercial profits
and hence constituted accumulated profits of the company..
within the meaning of s. 2(6A)(e).	PREAMBLE
[648D]

         (1) The term 'profits' in taxation law varies in its
meaning according to the context.	PREAMBLE
The expression 'accumu-
lated profits' occurring in s. 2(6A) means profits in the
commercial sense that is profits in the real and true sense
of the term and not assessable or taxable profits. [642E]

          (2) Although they are not identical and differ in some
material particulars, initial depreciation and development
rebate are similar in nature as both are by
639
way of incentive for installation of new machinery or plant.	PREAMBLE

But the initial depreciation or the development rebate is
not a recurring allowance for the subsequent years like the
normal depreciation allowance provided in s. 10(2)(vi) or
the additional depreciation provided in s. 10(2)(vi-a).	PREAMBLE
The
normal depreciation and the additional depreciation are
permitted to be deducted from the written down value.	PREAMBLE
But
the amount of the initial depreciation is not deductible in
determining the written down value.	PREAMBLE
[644D-E]

       (3) Normal depreciation reserve of the company may not
form part of the accumulated past profits as held in Commis-
sioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Viramgam .Mills Co. Ltd. (43
ITR 270).	PREAMBLE
But since the initial depreciation or the devel-
opment rebate	PREAMBLE
cannot be equated with normal depreciation	PREAMBLE
, it
is not a deductible item of cost or expenditure in. arriving
at the commercial profits.	PREAMBLE
The initial depreciation or the
development rebate is not allowed as an extra deductible
allowance of business expenses for meeting the costs of
replacement in future years, but they are meant merely to
	PREAMBLE
reduce	PREAMBLE
the tax liability of the assessee for the year of	PREAMBLE

installation only, in order to give him an incentive to
instal new machinery or plant [645D-F]	PREAMBLE


       (4) The purpose of s. 2(6A) is to include within the
term 'dividend', for the purpose of taxation, certain dis-
tributions or payments as deemed dividend.	PREAMBLE
Section 2(6A)(c)
provides that 'dividend' includes any distribution to the
shareholders liquidation to the extent to which the distri-
bution is attributable to accumulated profits.	PREAMBLE
In Tea
Estate India Pvt. Ltd. v. C.I.T., W. Bengal (103 ITR 785) it
was held that accumulated profits in cl. (c) include devel-
opment Tebate.	PREAMBLE
If for the purpose of distribution the
amount of development rebate could form part of the accumu-
lated profits of the company, a fortiori, it would be so far
the purpose of cl. (e) also.	PREAMBLE
[646B; 645G]	PREAMBLE


       (5)	PREAMBLE
The use of the expression 'whether capitalised or
not', as qualifying the expression 'accumulated profits' in
cls. (a) to (d), but not in cl. (e), shows that the legisla-
ture does not intend to rope in capitalised profits in el.
(e).	PREAMBLE
That is, to the extent the profits have been capita-
lised in accordance with the law and its Articles of Associ-

ation, a company cannot be said to possess any accumulated
profits.	PREAMBLE
But in the present case, the accumulated profits
of the company were never capitalised.	PREAMBLE
Merely transferring
the sum to the development reserve account by debiting it to
the profit and loss account did not amount to capitalisation
of profits.	PREAMBLE
The nature of the assets did not change out
continued to remain as profits.	PREAMBLE

 UNTWALIA, J.	NONE
This is an appeal by an assessee on grant of a certificate of fitness by the Bombay High Court under section 66A (2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922-hereinafter referred to as the 1922 Act.	FAC
The assessee is an individual.	FAC
We are concerned in this case with his assessment for the assessment year 1958-59-corresponding accounting year being 1st April, 1957 to 31st March, 1958.	FAC
The Income tax Tribu- nal made a composite order disposing of the assessee's 640 appeals in respect of two assessment years i.e. 1958-59 and 1959-60.	RLC
The decision of the Tribunal was partly in favour of the assessee and partly in favour of the Revenue.	RLC
In respect of the assessment year 1958-59, a reference under section 66(1) of the 1922 Act was made by the Tribunal to the High Court.	RLC
Four questions were referred-one at the instance of the Commissioner of Income-tax and three at the instance of the assessee.	RLC
The High Court by' its judgment under appeal which is reported in Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Bombay v. P.K. Badiani(1) has answered almost all the questions.	RLC
against the assessee.	RLC
Hence this appeal.	FAC

 Mr. V. Rajgopal who had argued the case of the assessee before the High Court appeared before us in support of the appeal also.	FAC
He could not and did not attack the decision of the High Court as respects questions 2, 3 and 4.	FAC
But he strenuously urged before us for reversal of the High Court judgment in regard to question No. 1 which was re- ferred at the instance of the Commissioner.	FAC
        If the assessee could succeed before us in getting an answer in his favour to the said question, then, substantially he would have succeeded in getting the whole of the relief.	FAC
The first and the only question which falls for our examination in' this appeal was referred by the Tribunal to the High Court in the following terms: "(1) Whether the development rebate reserve created by the company by duly charging the amount to the profit and loss account and being allowable under the Act constituted 'accumulated profits' of the company within the meaning of section 2(6A)(e) of the Act?"
 	ISSUE
We proceed to state the necessary facts for determina- tion of the above question only.	FAC

 The assessee was a major shareholder (although at the relevant time being a major or minor shareholder did not make any difference in law) in the Sadhana Textile Mills Pvt. Ltd. which was indisputably a Company in which the public were not substantially interested within the meaning of Section 23A of the 1922-Act.	FAC
The assessee was also the Managing Director of the said Private Limited Company.	FAC
He had a mutual open and current account in the books of the Company--the accounting year of which was the calendar year i.e. commencing from January and ending in December.	FAC
The assessee in his accounting year 1957-58 had withdrawn con- siderable amounts of money from the Company's account.	FAC

The Income-tax Officer' treated the withdrawals made by the assessee as advances or loans given by the Company to him and taxed the amount as dividend under section 2(6A)(e) of the 1922 Act.	FAC
The Appellate Assistant Commissioner modi- fied the figure of the deemed dividend calculated by the Income-tax Officer and took the highest amount of advance made (I) 76 I.T.R. 369.
641 to the assessee by the Company at a particular point of time in the year in question as the amount of dividend taxable in the hands of the assessee.	FAC
The said amount was within the total figure of accumulated profits in the hands of the Company at the relevant time, i.e. 31st December, 1956.	FAC
It may just be stated here that according to the 1922 Act only the accumulated profits possessed by the company at the. end of the corresponding previous year had to be taken into account unlike the corresponding provision engrafted in section 2(22) of the Income-tax Act, 1961--hereinafter referred to as the 1961 Act, read with Explanation II thereto.	FAC
It was found that the aggregate amount of develop- ment rebate allowed to the Company under section 10(2)(vi-b) was Rs. 2,36,470/-.	FAC
The said amount had been debited in the profit and loss account of the Company for the account- ing year 1966 leaving a balance of Rs. 6,641/- only in the profit and loss account.	FAC
The Appellate Assistant Commis- sioner of Income-tax treated the entire sum of Rs.
2,43,111/- as the amount of accumulated profits possessed by the Company.	FAC
Finding the highest amount of advance to the assessee.	FAC
at a particular ;point of time to be aggregating to Rs. 1,83,493.70 he directed the addition of the said amount in the assessee's income under section 2(6A)(e) of the 1922-Act.	FAC
The High Court has directed some modification in the calculation of the said amount while answering the other questions referred to it at the instance of the asses- see and we need not go into their details.	FAC

 The main question for our determination in this appeal is whether the aggregate of the development rebates allowed to the Company under section 10(2)(vi-b) of the 1'922-Act could be treated as accumulated profits in the hands of the Company under section 2(6A)(e).	ISSUE

 The Income-tax Acts have undergone numerous changes from time to time and various amendments have been made both in the 1922Act as also in the 1961-Act.	ANALYSIS
We shall do well to quote all the subclauses (a) to (e) of section 2(6A) of the 1922-Act.	ANALYSIS
They read as follows: "2(6A) "dividend" includes-- (a) any distribution by a company of accumulated profits whether capitalised or not, if such distri- bution entails the release by the company to its shareholders of all or any part of the assets of the company; (b) any distribution by a company of deben- tures, debenture-stock or deposit certificates in any form, whether with or without interest, to the extent to, which the company possesses accumulated profits, whether capitalised or not; (c) any distribution made to the shareholders of a company on its liquidation, to the extent to which the distribution is attributable to the accumulated profits of the company immediately before its liquidation, whether capitalised or not; 642 (d) any distribution by a company on the reduc- tion of its capital to the extent to which the company possesses accumulated profits which arose after the end of the previous year ending next before the 1st day of April, 1933, whether such accumulated profits have been capitalised or not; (e) any payment by a company, not being a company in which the public are substantially interested within the meaning of section 23A, of any sum (whether as representing a part of the assets of the company or otherwise) by way of advance or loan to a shareholder or any payment by any such company On behalf or for the individual benefit of a shareholder, to the extent to which the company in either case possesses accumulated profits;	STA
Explanation--The expression "accumulated profits," wherever it occurs in this clause, shall not include capital gains arising before the 1st day of April, 1946, or after the 31st day of March, 1948 and before the 1st day of April, 1956."	STA

 The expression "accumulated profits" occurring in clause (e) of section 6A, or as a matter of that in any of the other clauses, undoubtedly means profits in the commercial sense and not assessable or taxable profits liable to tax as income under the.1922 Act.	ANALYSIS
It is a well known concept of the taxation law that the term 'profits' in the various sections of the Income-tax Acts have not got the same meaning.	ANALYSIS
In the context --sometimes it means the assessable profits and sometimes it means the commercial profits.	ANALYSIS
In Palmer's Company Law, Twenty First Edition at page 662 the distinc- tion between profits, divisible profits and profits avail- able for dividend has been pointed out.	ANALYSIS
At the said page occurs an oft quoted classical passage from the judgment of Fletcher Moulton, L.J., in Re Spanish Prospecting Co. Ltd.
 (1) which runs thus: "'Profits' implies a comparison between the state of a business at two specific dates usually separated by an interval of a year.	ANALYSIS
The fundamen- tal meaning is the amount of gain made by the business during the year.	ANALYSIS
This can only be ascer- tained by a comparison of the assets of the busi- ness at the two dates ......	ANALYSIS
If the total assets of the business at the two dates be compared, the increase which they show at the later date as compared with the earlier date (due allowance of course being made for any capital introduced into or taken out of the business in the meanwhile) represents in strictness the profits of the busi- ness during the period in question."	ANALYSIS

 Bhagwati, J. has quoted the above passage with approval in the case of E.D. Sassoon & Company Ltd. and others v. Com- missioner of Income-tax, Bombay City.('2) Almost to the same effect ,was the view (1) [1911] 1 Ch. 92, 98.  (2) 26 I.T.R. 27 at page 46.
 643 expressed by Mahajan, J. as he then was, in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Ahmedbhai Umarbhai & Co., Bombay(1) In Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City v. Bipinchandra Maganlal & Co. Ltd.('2) Shah, J., as he then was, delivering the judgment on behalf of the Court while interpreting the expression "smallness of profits" occur- ring in section 23A of the 1922 Act said at page 296: "A company normally distributes dividends out of its business profits and not out of its assessa- ble income.	PRE_RELIED
There is no definable relation between the assessable income and the profits of a business concerned in a commercial sense.	PRE_RELIED
Computation of income for purposes of assessment of income-tax is based on a variety of artificial rules and takes into account several fictional receipts, deductions and allowances ..............	PRE_RELIED
Smallness of the profit in section 23A has to be adjudged in the light of commercial principles and not in the light of total receipts, actual or fictional."
 	PRE_RELIED
The same view has been expressed by this Court in Gobald Motor Service (P) Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Ma- dras(3).	PRE_RELIED
We think that the term "profits" occurring in section 2(6A)(e) of the 1922 Act means profits in the com- mercial sense-that is to say the profits made by the Company in the real and true sense of the term.	PRE_RELIED
,We may just give one example.	PRE_RELIED
Suppose the assessable profit of a company is Rs. 1,00,000/- out of which the Company had to pay a tax under the Income-tax Act--say to the extent of Rs.
 30,000/-. .Although payment of tax is not a sum deductible from the assessable profits of the Company, in the commer- cial sense the Company would be left with a sum of Rs.
 70,000/- only as profits.	PRE_RELIED
We may add that Mr. Rajgopal could not and did not seriously dispute this proposition of law.	ARG_PETITIONER

 The gravamen of the argument of the assessee has been that development rebate deductible from the assessable profits of the Company is also.	ARG_PETITIONER
a type of outgoing expendi- ture or out-of-pocket cost which is deductible while ascertaining the profits of the Company in the commercial sense.	ARG_PETITIONER
Counsel submitted that it is in the nature of a depreciation allowance and is identical with initial depre- ciation; it should, therefore, be deducted from the commer- cial profits of the Company as held by the Gujarat High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay North v. Viramgam Mills Co. Ltd. (4).	ANALYSIS
This argument found favour with the Tribunal but was repelled by the High Court.	ANALYSIS

 The point is res integra and we have to examine the correct- ness of the view expressed by the High Court.	ANALYSIS

 Depreciation allowance has been allowed to be deducted from the assessable .profits of an assessee under section 10(2) (vi) of the 1922 Act corresponding to section 32 of the 1961 Act.	ANALYSIS
It would appear from the report of the Taxation Enquiry Commission 1953-54 Vol. II as to what is the nature of the depreciation allowance; vide Chapter V, page 74.	ANALYSIS

 644 the 1922 Act is permitted to be deducted from the 'written downvalue'.	ANALYSIS
By and large, the cost of replacements is allowed as deductions in lieu of depreciation in respect of certain assets.	ANALYSIS
By the amendments made by the Income-tax Amendment Act, 1946., the Finance Act, 1955 and the Finance Act, 1956 certain initial depreciation was allowed in re- spect of buildings newly erected or the machinery and plant newly installed.	ANALYSIS
Obviously, it was by way of an incentive for the new structures or the new installations.	ANALYSIS
The amount of initial depreciation was not deductible in deter- mining the 'written down value' although under proviso (c) it was to be taken into account in the aggregate of all allowances so as not to permit them to exceed the maximum limit provided therein.	ANALYSIS
Development rebate was provided in clause (vi-b) with effect from 1st April, 1955 by the Fi- nance Act of 1955.	ANALYSIS
There was an over-lapping period of about two years in relation to the allowance of initial depreciation or the development rebate.	ANALYSIS
But as provided for in clause (vi) an assessee could not have' had both even in regard to that period.	ANALYSIS
Although initial depreciation and development rebate were not identical as they differed in some material particulars, they were similar in nature as both were by way of incentive for installation of new ma- chinery or plant.	ANALYSIS
The initial depreciation or the develop- ment rebate was to be allowed, as the case may be; at a certain percentage of the actual cost of the machinery or the plant for the year of installation only.	ANALYSIS
It was not a recurring allowance for the subsequent years like; the allowance of the normal depreciation or the additional depreciation.	ANALYSIS
The Taxation Enquiry Commission in its report aforesaid had recommended in Chapter VII, page 98 of Vol. II for assisting the expansion and development of :productive enterprise by allowing them a proportion of new investment in fixed assets to be charged to current costs of production thereby permitting the taxable profits to be brought down to that extent.	ANALYSIS
In the Finance Act of 1955 a provision was made to allow a development rebate of 25% of the cost of all new plant and machinery installed for business purposes instead of the then existing initial depreciation allowance of 20%.	ANALYSIS
It would thus be seen that by way of an incentive for installation of new machinery and plants initial depreciation allowance of 20% was replaced by a develop- ment'rebate of 25%.	ANALYSIS
But it was, like grant of export rebate by way of incentive to make more exports, in the nature of an incentive for setting up new machineries and plants.	ANALYSIS
We do not find any warrant for accepting the contention of Mr. Rajgopal that the initial depreciation or the develop- ment rebate was allowed as 'an extra deductible allowance of business expenses in the year of installation of new machin- ery for meeting the ever increasing costs of its replacement in future years.	ANALYSIS
In our opinion it was meant merely to reduce the tax liability of the assessee in order to give him an incentive to instal new machineries or plants.	ANALYSIS

 The Gujarat High Court in the case of Viramgam Mills Co.
Ltd. (supra) was concerned with the question as to whether the normal depreciation reserve of .'the Company could be taken to be the accumulations of past profits within the meaning of the proviso to section 23A of the 1922 Act as it stood at the relevant time.	PRE_RELIED
It held that it could not form part of the accumulated past profits as in the words of Wixon (vide Wixon's Accounts Hand Book) it was "the estimat- ed 645 expiration of asset value" or as observed by Paton in his Accountants' Hand Book, Third edition it is an out-of-pocket cost as any other cost.	PRE_RELIED
Says the learned author in the above book at p. 746 thus: "There is still widespread misapprehension as to the precise significance of the depreciation charge.	PRE_RELIED
It is often deemed a more or less imagi- nary and hypothetical :element, and is sharply contrasted with the regular "out-of-pocket" oper- ating costs.	PRE_RELIED
As a matter of fact there is nothing at all imaginary about depreciation as a cost of business operation and at bottom it is just as much 'an out-of-pocket cost as any other.	PRE_RELIED
The deprecia- tion charge is merely the periodic operating aspect of fixed-asset costs, and there is no doubt as to the reality of such costs.	PRE_RELIED
Far from being a non-out-of pocket charge depreciation represents the extreme example of prepayment."	PRE_RELIED

 Mr. S.T. Desai, learned counsel for the Revenue drew our attention to the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Commissioner of Income tax.	ARG_RESPONDENT
Calcutta v. Sri Bibhuti Bhusan Dutt(1) and submitted that it has taken a view different from the one taken by the Gujarat High Court even in regard to the nature of normal 'depreciation allowance.	ARG_RESPONDENT
The Calcut- ta case seems to be one of a property-holding company, the profits of which were assessable under section 9 wherein the question of depreciation was not relevant.	ANALYSIS
It is not neces- sary for us to examine in this case the exact nature of the normal depreciation allowance and whether it is deductible from the profits of a person while determining his commer- cial profits.	ANALYSIS
The view expressed by the Gujarat High Court seems to be reasonably plausible and correct and for the purposes of this case we shall assume it to be so.	ANALYSIS
Yet, we do not feel persuaded to accept the argument of the assessee and equate the initial depreciation or the develop- ment rebate with the normal depreciation.	ANALYSIS
In our opinion such an allowance is in no sense a deductible item of cost or expenditure in the process of settlement of the commer- cial profits.	ANALYSIS
Although it does not form part of the assessable profits, undoubtedly it does form part of the commercial profits.	ANALYSIS

 Tea Estate India Pvt. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal 11 (and vice versa)(2) one of us (Khanna, J.) delivering the judgment on behalf of the Court has interpreted the, expression "accumulated profits" occur- ring in clause (c) of section '2(6A) of the 1922 Act to include the amount of development rebate in the commercial sense.	PRE_RELIED
It has been stated at page 794: "The acceptance of the contention would necessarily postulate reading in section 2(6A)(c) the words "accumulated profits as are liable to be taxed under the Act".	PRE_RELIED
The words "as are liable to be taxed under the Act" are not there in the definition and it would not, in our opinion, be permissible to so construe the clause as if those words were a part of that clause.	ANALYSIS
There is also nothing in the language (1) 48 I.T.R. 233.                                  (2) 103 I.T.R. 785.
 646	ANALYSIS
Or Context of that clause as would warrant such a construction.	ANALYSIS
Accumulated profits would retain their character as such even though a part of them were not taxed as profits under the Act."
 	ANALYSIS
The purpose of section 2 (6A) of the 1922 Act corresponding to section 2(22) of the 1961 Act is to include within the term "dividend" for the purpose of taxation certain distri- butions or payments of certain items of money or the like as deemed dividend for the purpose of taxation.	ANALYSIS
Under clause (e) an advance or loan or money to a shareholder by a pri- vate Company has been directed to be treated as dividend to the extent to which the Company possessed accumulated profits.	ANALYSIS
The advance or the loan, by a legal fiction, is to resemble the actual dividend.	ANALYSIS
For the purpose of distribu- tion of the dividend the amount of development rebate could form part of the profits of the Company; a fortiori, it would be so far the purposes of clause (e) also.	ANALYSIS
During the course of the arguments of this appeal, our attention was directed to a new facet of the question under consideration and that is this.	ANALYSIS
In clauses (a) to (d) of section 2(6A) of the 1922-Act so also in the corresponding clauses of section 2(22) of the 1961-Act the expression "accumulated profits" is qualified by the expression "whether capitalised or not".	ANALYSIS
But the latter phrase is conspicuously absent in clause (e).	ANALYSIS
What is the purpose of this difference in the phraseology of the various clauses of sub-section (6A) ?	ANALYSIS
The reason is -not far to seek and yet not helpful to the assessee in this case.	ANALYSIS
