 	PREAMBLE
The Appellant in R.A.249/2015 has filed the appeal questioning the correctness and legality of the judgment and decree dated 31.08.2015 in O.S.No.546/2007 on the file of Court of Principal Judge, Small Causes and Senior Civil Judge, Mysuru.	FAC

 The Appellant in R.A.250/2015 has filed the appeal questioning the correctness and legality of the judgment and decree dated 31.08.2015 in O.S.No.471/2009 on the file of Court of Principal Judge, Small Causes and Senior Civil Judge, Mysuru.	FAC
2. The appellant in both the cases was the Plaintiff in O.S.546/2007 and Defendant in O.S.471/2009.	FAC
Both suits were disposed by common judgment dated; 31.08.2015.	FAC
For the sake of brevity, parties are addressed as per their rank in O.S.546/2007.	FAC

 Facts in brief: 3.	FAC
The parties to the lis are brothers and children of late Neelappa Shetty.	FAC
He had bequeathed the suit schedule property in favour of both his children under registered `Will dated 18.03.1997, but had created life interest in favour of his wife.	FAC

Both their parents are no more and hence they are in joint possession of the suit schedule property as co-owners.	FAC

Defendant had filed H.R.C 120/2006 on the file of Principal Civil Judge (Jr.Dn), Mysuru for ejectment against the plaintiff from the suit schedule property and in that case, he claimed that their father had executed `Will' on 16.04.2003 bequeathing the entire property to the Defendant.	FAC
The said `Will' is a sham document and no such `Will' was executed by their father.	FAC
He is having  share in the suit schedule property and when demanded to effect partition, Defendant had denied the same.	FAC
Hence, he filed suit for partition and separate possession of his  share.	FAC
4. Defendant filed written statement admitting the relationship with the Plaintiff.	FAC
He had also admitted that their father Neelappa Shetty had executed `Will' on 18.03.1996.	FAC
It was his case that the said `Will' was not in force as the same was cancelled by his father during his life time.	FAC
The Plaintiff had relinquished his right over the suit schedule property by receiving Rs.1,25,000/- from his father and had executed a document to that effect on 22.12.2003.	FAC
As such, his father after canceling the earlier `Will' had bequeathed the entire property in his favour.	FAC
The Plaintiff was inducted as a tenant in the 2nd floor on a monthly rent of Rs.750/- and hence he had filed H.R.C.120/2006 for eviction.	FAC
He is the absolute owner of the entire suit property and as such Plaintiff is not entitled for his  share.	FAC
Therefore it was prayed to dismiss the suit.	FAC
5. Subsequently, Defendant filed O.S.471/2009 against the Plaintiff taking the aforesaid contentions in his written statement filed in O.S.546/2007.	FAC
In that case, written statement came to be filed by the Plaintiff pleading similar facts as to what he had stated in O.S.546/2007.	FAC
6. By virtue of the aforesaid pleadings, the Learned Civil Judge had framed the following common Issues in both the suits: - ISSUES IN O.S.546/2007 1.	FAC
Whether the Plaintiff proves that Plaintiff and Defendant are joint co- owners of the suit schedule property as per `Will' dated 18.03.1997?	ISSUE
2. Whether Defendant proves that Neelappa Shetty was cancelled `Will' dated 18.03.1997 and he was executed `Will' dated 16.04.2003 bequeathing the plaint schedule property in favour of the Defendant?
 3. Whether Court Fee paid by the Plaintiff is insufficient?
 4. Whether Plaintiff is entitled for the relief as prayed for?
 5.	ISSUE
What Order or Decree?	ISSUE

        ISSUES IN O.S.471/2009 1.	ISSUE
Whether the Plaintiff proves that he is the absolute owner in possession of suit schedule property?	ISSUE

 2. Whether the Plaintiff proves that the Defendant is in permissive possession of suit schedule property?	ISSUE
3. Whether the Defendant proves that the Plaintiff and Defendant are joint owners of the suit schedule property?	ISSUE
4. Whether the Plaintiff proves that he is entitled for possession of the suit schedule property?	ISSUE

 5. Whether the Plaintiff is entitled for the relief as prayed?	ISSUE
6. What Order or Decree?	ISSUE
7. In order to substantiate the plaint averments, the Plaintiff examined him as P.W.1 and got marked seven documents as Ex.P.1 to P.7.	FAC
Per contra, Defendant examined him as D.W.1 and examined two witnesses as D.Ws.2 and 3.
Fourteen documents in all came to be marked as Ex.D.1 to Ex.D.14.
 8.	FAC
Since common evidence came to be recorded, both the suits came to be disposed by common judgment and decree dated 31.08.2015.	FAC
The suit of the Plaintiff in O.S.546/2007 came to be dismissed and the suit filed by the Defendant in O.S.471/2009 came to be decreed.	FAC
The Plaintiff was directed to vacate and hand over vacant possession of portion of suit property to the Defendant within 3 months from the date of the said judgment.	FAC

 9. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed in both the suits, the Appellant has come before this Court urging the following common grounds in both the appeals : -	ARG_PETITIONER
The Learned Trial Judge had erred in giving finding to Issue No.1 as Negative that Plaintiff and Defendant are not joint owners of the suit schedule property as per Will dated 18.03.1997, even though the Appellant /Plaintiff proved the Will and further the Defendant himself has admitted the same at the time of passing impugned judgment and decree.	ARG_PETITIONER

 The Learned Trial Judge further erred in giving finding as Affirmative to Issue No.2 that Neelappa Shetty had cancelled the Will dated 18.03.1997 and he has executed Will dated 16.04.2003 bequeathing the plaint schedule property in favour of Defendant, even though the alleged Will dated 16.04.2003 is doubtful one.	ARG_PETITIONER

 The Learned Trial Judge further erred in not taking into consideration of the fact that the intention of the father of Plaintiff and Defendant was to give suit schedule property equally to the plaintiff and Defendant and not only to the Defendant.	ARG_PETITIONER

 The Learned Trial Judge further at the time of passing impugned judgment and decree erred in not taking into consideration of the fact that the evidence of D.W.1 i.e, Defendant and during the course of cross-examination there is lot of contradictions in his evidence about the execution of Will was shrouded with suspicious circumstances.	ARG_PETITIONER
The Learned Trial Judge further erred in believing the evidence of D.W.2 and 3 they are alleged to be attestors of the alleged `Will' even though there are lot of contradictions in their evidence.
 The Learned Trial Judge erred in believing and taking into consideration of Ex.D.1 alleged to be Release Deed executed by the Plaintiff, even though that document is not at all admissible in evidence as it is a unregistered one.
 	ARG_PETITIONER
The Learned Trial Judge further erred in not giving opportunity to the Plaintiff to lead further evidence during the course of trial even though the Plaintiff/Appellant made several applications seeking permission from the hands of the Hon'ble Court.	ARG_PETITIONER
Viewed from any angle, the impugned judgment and decree passed by the Learned Civil Judge is capricious one and erroneous one in the eye of law and same is liable to be set aside by this Hon'ble Court by interfering with the same.	ARG_PETITIONER

 Therefore, he prays to set aside common judgment and decree by allowing the appeals.	ARG_PETITIONER
Inter-alia, he has prayed to decree his suit in O.S.546/2007 and dismiss O.S.471/2009.	ARG_PETITIONER
10. By virtue of the above facts and circumstances the common points that would arise for my consideration are:- 1. Whether the impugned common judgment and decree of the lower court is opposed to law, facts and circumstances of the case and interference of this court is necessary?	ISSUE

 2. What Order?	ISSUE
11. I have heard the arguments on both sides and also perused the written arguments submitted by the Appellant.	NONE
12. My findings on the above points are as under:- Point No.1 : Negative.
                  Point No.2 : As per final order for the following: R E A S O N S Point No.1 in both cases: - 13.	ANALYSIS
The relationship between the parties is not in dispute.	ANALYSIS
It is an admitted fact that their father Neelappa Shetty had executed `Will' on 18.03.1997 creating life interest in favour of his wife and after her death, the Plaintiff and Defendant would be equally entitled for the property.	ANALYSIS
Defendant contended that the Plaintiff after executing Ex.D.1 had received Rs.1,25,000/- from his father releasing his rights over the suit property and hence on 16.04.2003, his father had executed Ex.D.2/`Will' exclusively in his favour and hence Plaintiff would not have any share much less any rights in the suit schedule property.	ANALYSIS

Defendant contended that by virtue of Ex.D.2/`Will', he is the absolute owner of the suit property.	ANALYSIS
The Plaintiff produced the Certified Copy of `Will' dated 18.03.1997, which came to be marked as Ex.P.1.	ANALYSIS
He had not produced the original `Will'.	ANALYSIS
In fact, Defendant himself produced the said original `Will', which came to be marked as Ex.D.9.	ANALYSIS
The custody of the original `Will' with the Defendant endorses the plea taken by him in his written statement that his father had cancelled the said `Will' and thereafter, executed Ex.D.2/`Will' on 16.04.2003.	ANALYSIS
It is also pertinent to note that the Plaintiff had not examined any attestors or the scribe of the `Will' dated 18.03.1997.	ANALYSIS
Except for the self serving testimony of the Plaintiff, he had not adduced cogent evidence to prove that he is having  share in the suit property by virtue of Ex.P.1/`Will' dated: 18.03.1997.
 14.	ANALYSIS
The Defendant had produced the original `Will' dated 16.04.2003, which came to be marked as Ex.D.2.	ANALYSIS
In Order to prove that by virtue of the said `Will', he became the absolute owner of the suit property, Defendant examined the attestors of the said will namely Anand and Ramesh as D.Ws.2 and 3 respectively.	ANALYSIS
These witnesses have spoken about their presence at the time of preparing Ex.D.2/`Will'.	ANALYSIS
They also spoke about sound disposing state of mind of Sri.Neelappa Shetty while executing the said `Will'.	ANALYSIS
They also spoke that there are recitals in Ex.D.2 that earlier `Will' executed by Neelappa Shetty on 18.03.1997 was cancelled and the suit schedule property was exclusively bequeathed in favour of the Defendant.	ANALYSIS
Nothing worthwhile was elicited by the counsel for Plaintiff through these witnesses.	ANALYSIS
As such, the Learned Civil Judge had rightly held that the Defendant had proved execution of Ex.D.2/`Will' as per Section 68 of Evidence Act.	ANALYSIS
I do not find any error in the said finding given by the Lower Court after appreciating the evidence surrounding Ex.P.1 and D.2/`Wills'.
 15. Execution of Ex.D.1 Release Deed	ANALYSIS
came to be disputed by the Plaintiff.	ANALYSIS
Arguments were addressed before this Court that Ex.D.1 does not reflect as to in respect of what property the Plaintiff had released his rights and since it is not specifically mentioned therein that Plaintiff has not released his rights in and over the suit schedule property the said document would be of no relevance.	ANALYSIS
It was also argued that it is not a registered document and hit by Section 17 of the Registration Act.	ANALYSIS
Per contra, Learned Counsel for the Defendant submitted that the said document was for limited collateral purpose and as no relief is sought on the said document, it can be read in evidence.	ARG_RESPONDENT

 16. It is pertinent to note that Ex.D.1 Release Deed was marked after confronting it to the Plaintiff during his cross- examination.	ANALYSIS
In his cross-examination dated 19.06.2014, at Page 5, Plaintiff admitted of executing Ex.D.1 Release Deed after receiving Rs.1,25,000/- from his father.	ANALYSIS
In view of his clear and unequivocal admission of executing the Release Deed and receiving Rs.1,25,000/- in all through cheques, the said Release Deed came to be marked as Ex.D.1.	ANALYSIS
Though it is an unregistered document, in view of the admission made by the Plaintiff, it can be read in evidence.	ANALYSIS
It is not the case of the Plaintiff that there were several properties belonging to the family.	ANALYSIS
Hence, it can be presumed that he had in fact received Rs.1,25,000/- in all and relinquished his rights in the suit property.	ANALYSIS
Hence, the arguments addressed by the counsel for Plaintiff, as above does not have any force.	ANALYSIS
For the same reason, the judgments in ILR- 2010-Karnataka-3552 and ILR-2015-Karnataka-2939 relied by the Plaintiff are of no use to him.	ANALYSIS
In fact, the same arguments were addressed in the Court below and the Learned Civil Judge was right in rejecting the same and accepting Ex.D.1 in evidence.	ANALYSIS

 17. Defendant failed to prove that Plaintiff was inducted as a tenant on monthly rent of Rs.750/-.	ANALYSIS
He failed to get any relief in H.R.C.120/2006.	ANALYSIS
Admittedly, the Plaintiff is in possession of the suit house property in a portion.	ANALYSIS
Since he had admitted of relinquishing his rights in the suit property after receiving amount from his father, the Learned Civil Judge had rightly presumed and held that he was in permissive possession in portion of suit property.	ANALYSIS
Defendant had proved beyond probability that by virtue of Ex.D.2/`Will' dated 14.06.2003, he became the absolute owner of the entire suit property.	ANALYSIS

Therefore, the Plaintiff was directed to deliver vacant possession of the portion in which he was in possession to the Defendant within 3 months from the date of the impugned judgment.	ANALYSIS

 18. It appears from the material on record that Defendant had sought mesne profits apart from the relief of possession.	ANALYSIS
In the operative portion of the impugned judgment, the Learned Civil Judge had held that there shall be an enquiry in respect of the mesne profits in Final Decree Proceedings and directed the office to prepare Preliminary Decree.	ANALYSIS
A Preliminary Decree is prepared only in the suit of partition and in mortgage related suits and at any rate not in a suit for possession.	ANALYSIS
The suit for partition filed by the Plaintiff was dismissed and hence there was no preliminary decree to be drawn.	ANALYSIS
In other words, no Final Decree Proceedings can be initiated by the Defendant in a decree obtained by him for possession.	ANALYSIS
He can at best file a Miscellaneous Petition for enquiry into future mesne profits.	ANALYSIS
As such, I am of the opinion that the operative portion of the judgment requires to be modified.	NONE
Otherwise, in respect of the issues and other facts, the Learned Civil Judge has properly appreciated the oral and documentary evidence and has rightly came to the conclusion that Plaintiff had failed to prove that he is having  share in the suit schedule property.	RATIO
He had also rightly appreciated the material on record and also appreciated the evidence of D.Ws.2 and 3 in proper perspective and rightly held that Defendant had proved execution of Ex.D.2/`Will'.
Consequently, I find no reason or valid grounds to interfere with the well-reasoned judgment or the findings given therein.
Hence, I answer point for consideration in the `Negative'.	RATIO

 Point No.2: 19. By virtue of the above discussion, reasons stated and finding given to point No.1, the following is made; ORDER Appeals in R.A.249/2015 as well as R.A.250/2015 stands dismissed.	RPC

 The common judgment and decree dated 31.08.2015 passed in O.S.546/2007 and O.S.471/2009 on the file of Principal Judge, Court of Small Causes, Mysuru is confirmed.	RPC

 Suit of the Plaintiff in O.S.546/2007 is dismissed and the suit in O.S.471/2009 is decreed.	RPC

 The Defendant in O.S.471/2009 Sri.Hoysala G.N is hereby directed to vacate and deliver vacant possession of the portion of the property in his possession to the Plaintiff in the said case Sri.G.N.Shashi Kumar within 3 months from the date of this Order.	RPC

 The Plaintiff in O.S.471/2009 is at liberty to file his separate Miscellaneous Petition for enquiry into future mesne profits.	RPC
Draw decree as above.	RPC
Send copy of this judgment along with lower Court records.	NONE
