The petitioner most humbly & respectfully submits as under, 1. That the petitioner and respondent are settled the present case and filed the present petition before this Hon'ble Court.	FAC

FAC

 6. It is submitted that this Hon'ble Court also quashed the proceedings in Criminal Petition No.200579/2018 on dated 10-10-2018 under section 498(A), 323, 504, 506, 307 R/w 34 IPC when parties arrived to compromise the matter.	FAC

 7. That, this Hon'ble Court has got vide and ample power to exercise to allow the compromise petition and to quash the Trial court proceedings.	FAC

 PRAYER Wherefore, It is humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court be pleased allow this compromise petition and thereby quash the FIR in Crime No 28/2019 registered by the Bidar Town PS for the offence punishable under section 143, 147, 148, 307, 323, 324, 354, 504, 506 R/w 149 IPC pending on the file of Addl. Senior Civil Judge & CJM Court Bidar, in the interest of law and justice."	FAC

 3. A perusal of the criminal petition will show that the petitioners have sought for quashing of the proceedings in Crime No.28/2019 pending on the file of Additional Senior Civil Judge and CJM Court, Bidar.	FAC

 4. As stated above, all the parties are present before the Court and they are identified by their respective counsel.	NONE
Complainant/respondent No.2 submits that she has settled dispute of her own wish and volition and without any pressure from any one and that she is willing to withdraw the present case filed by her.	FAC

 5. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh V/s State of Punjab and another, reported in (2012) 10 SCC Page No.303 has laid down the certain principles as to in what circumstance, the proceedings can be quashed particularly, when the dispute is matrimonial and private in nature.	PRE_RELIED
The said guidelines reads thus: "Held, power of High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from power of a criminal Court of compounding offences under Section 320 Cases where power to quash criminal proceedings may be exercised where the parties have settled their dispute, held, depends on facts and circumstances of each case-before exercise of inherent power under Section 482.	PRE_RELIED
High Court must have due regard to nature and gravity of the crime and its societal impact.	PRE_RELIED
Thus, held heinous and serious offences of mental depravity, murder, rape, dacoity, etc., or under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or offences committed by public servants while working in their capacity as public servants, cannot be quashed even though victim or victim's family and offender have settled the dispute-such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on society."
 6.	ANALYSIS
The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Narinder Singh and others V/s State of Punjab and Another, reported in (2014) 6 SCC 466 has held as under: "Cr.P.C. Section 482- Quashment of proceedings on basis of settlement between parties  offence alleged under Section 307 IPC- Falls in the category of heinous and serious offences and generally to be treated as crime against society  	PRE_RELIED
Power of quashment in such cases  guidelines laid down  	PRE_RELIED
Held, only because FIR / charge sheet incorporates provisions of Section 307 IPC would not, by itself, be a ground to reject the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and refuse to accept the settlement between the parties  	PRE_RELIED
Quashment of proceedings depends on facts and circumstances of each case  	PRE_RELIED
Detailed guidelines laid down (in para 29) for High Courts to form a view under what circumstances it should accept the settlement between the parties and quash the proceedings and when it should refrain from doing so- Cases where Court had approved quashing of proceedings under Section 307 of IPC and where it was rejected, considered  Penal Code, 1860, Section 307."
 7. Keeping in view the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the aforesaid decisions and considering the entire facts of the present case and the compromise / settlement entered between the parties, I am of the view that this is a fit case where the inherent power under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is required to be exercised by this Court as no useful purpose will be served in continuing the criminal proceedings before the trial Court.	ANALYSIS
Under these circumstances, I deem it fit to exercise inherent power under Section 428 of Cr.P.C. and quash the proceedings before the trial Court to secure the ends of justice.	RATIO

 8. In view of the aforesaid discussion, I pass the following order: ORDER 1) The petition filed under Section 320 (2) of Cr.P.C. is allowed.	RPC

 2) The parties are permitted to compound the offences.	RPC
The compromise petition filed by the parties is accepted.	RPC
In terms of the above said compromise, the proceedings pending against the petitioners in Crime No.28/2019 on the file of Additional Senior Civil Judge and CJM Court, Bidar are hereby quashed.	RPC

 The Criminal Petition is allowed in terms of the above order.	RPC
